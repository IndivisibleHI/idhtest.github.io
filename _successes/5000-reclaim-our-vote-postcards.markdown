Purging voters has been used for decades to suppress eligible voters of color, especially in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia.  We signed up with Reclaim Our Vote to undo this wrong.  1000 postcards have been mailed on August 1st to Florida.  Just signed to write 4000 more to be mailed on September 1st to Texas.
