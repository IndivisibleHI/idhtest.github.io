Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates and State Senate

The purpose of this effort was to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state and we did it.  VIRGINIA JUST GOT BLUER.  We flipped 6 House seats and 2 Senate seats. Dems are now the majority on the House side at 55 to 45 and also on the Senate side at 21 to 19. WOW! Over ten week period August to mid-October, 70 Indivisible Hawaii volunteers wrote over 4200 postcards4va GOTV postcards to support the Virginian Democratic candidates.  

Mahalo nui loa everyone for all your work! We write. We Vote. We WIN!
