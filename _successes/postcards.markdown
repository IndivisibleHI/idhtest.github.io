Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates and State Senate

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. We write. We Vote. We WIN!

Over last ten weeks our [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) team in Hawaii completed over 4200 postcards and letters for Virginia House of Delegates Progressive Democrats Dan Helmer,Elizabeth Guzman, Lindsey Dougherty, and Virginia State Senate Progressive Democrats Qusam Rashid and Annette Hyde.

To date (10/20/19):
* We've had 22 post card writing parties with 70 volunteers 
* 17 volunteers have created their own [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) accounts and are writing more than 500 GOTV (Get Out The Vote) postcards.

Thanks everyone for all your work!
