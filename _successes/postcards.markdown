Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. We write. We Vote. We WIN!

Last week our [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) team in Hawaii completed over 540 postcards for Virginia House of Delegates Progressive Democrats Dan Helmer and Elizabeth Guzman.

To date
* We've had 8 post card writing parties with 55 volunteers 
* 13 volunteers have created their own [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) accounts and are writing more than 900 GOTV (Get Out The Vote) postcards.
* We have 1,334 written, addressed and stamped GOTV postcards ready to mail 

More parties are scheduled for this weekend. Check the Postcards4VA events on our website. 

Thanks everyone for all your work!
