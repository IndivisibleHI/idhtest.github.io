Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates and State Senate

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. We write. We Vote. We WIN!

Over last nine weeks our [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) team in Hawaii completed almost 3800 postcards for Virginia House of Delegates Progressive Democrats Dan Helmer,Elizabeth Guzman, Lindsey Dougherty, and Virginia State Senate Progressive Democrat Qusam Rashid.

To date (10/13/19):
* We've had 19 post card writing parties with 65 volunteers 
* 17 volunteers have created their own [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) accounts and are writing more than 1000 GOTV (Get Out The Vote) postcards.
* We have close to 3228 written, addressed and stamped GOTV postcards ready to mail 

Last set of parties are scheduled for this week. Check the Postcards4VA events on our website. 

Thanks everyone for all your work!
