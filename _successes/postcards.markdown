Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. We write. We Vote. We WIN!

Last week our [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) team in Hawaii completed over 482 postcards for Virginia House of Delegates Progressive Democrats Dan Helmer and Elizabeth Guzman.

To date
* We've had 11 post card writing parties with 57 volunteers 
* 17 volunteers have created their own [postcards4va.com](http://postcards4va.com) accounts and are writing more than 1000 GOTV (Get Out The Vote) postcards.
* We have 1,816 written, addressed and stamped GOTV postcards ready to mail 

More parties are scheduled for this weekend. Check the Postcards4VA events on our website. 

Thanks everyone for all your work!
