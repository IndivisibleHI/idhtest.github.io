Postcarding for Virginia House of Delegates and State Senate

The purpose of this effort was to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state and we did it.  VIRGINIA JUST GOT BLUER - 55 Dems are now the majority on House side and 21 Dems are now the majority on Senate side.  Over ten week period August to mid-October, 70 Indivisible Hawaii volunteers wrote over 4200 postcards4va GOTV postcards to support the Virginian Democratic candidates.  

Thanks everyone for all your work! We write. We Vote. We WIN!
