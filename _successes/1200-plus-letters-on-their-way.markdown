In February, over 72 volunteers worked together to produce and mail 1,300 powerful Voter Registration letters to Citizens in the crucial swing states of Colorado and North Carolina. We are testing if "high impact" personal letters sent to hard to reach, unregistered citizens will generate new voters. We think so. With your powerful letters, we can demonstrate the best way to reach these Golden Voters.

We also starting to bank GOTV (Get Out The Vote) letters to Democratic leaning voters in our target states of CO, NC, AZ and ME. These will be mailed in October, just before the General Elections.  We've already distributed addresses for 1,120 GOTV letters.  Keep writing.

Our Goals in March are to double the number of our volunteer letter writers. Please recruit friends.

* Write follow-up, personal postcards to our 1300 Golden Citizens. 
* Download your own  GOTV letters and write from home.  

We are adapting our tactics to WRITING AT HOME to register new Democrats in swing states and to get registered Democrats in swing states out to vote.

To follow CDC's recommendation for social distancing, the March schedule will remain but the location will now serve as a venue to provide a one-on-one exchange of new letters and materials, instructions and training to write letters from home.

Here's how you can access information to participate:
Option 1. Learn how to get your own letters and write from home. Swing Left has comprehensive step by step training online - https://swingleft.org/writelettersfromhome

Option 2. Come by to pick up new materials, sample letters and get training at a one-person-at-time exchange at our previously scheduled meetings. There will be limited space at the house party in Kapolei, Democratic Party office, and the house party in Kakaako for you to stay and write together as well.
