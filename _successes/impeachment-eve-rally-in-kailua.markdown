Thanks to all who participated in the December Indivisible Impeachment Eve rally at the Castle Hospital intersection in Kailua.

We had at least 80 people, including folks from Australia and Canada who turned out to wave signs. We also had Indivisible Regional organizers from the western region.  Our great signs and energy gained overwhelming support from oncoming traffic!
