Thanks to all of you who were able to participate in the Nov 18th Indivisible Hawaii Statewide Network call. 

1. Lorna Strand provided an update on the **Party-Run Presidential Primary**. Key take away is that if you want to receive a mail in ballot you need to register with the Democratic Party by Feb 18 for the first ballot mailing or March 8th for the 2nd ballot mailing. You can still vote at Voter Resource Centers on primary vote day. We will work on providing some simple scripts for folks to use to make outreach calls.  A copy of Lorna’s excellent slides are attached.


2. **Indivisible Hawaii 2020 Blue Wave** Team Leader Younghee Overly, Voter Outreach Team Leader Gil Mendelson and Ditch Mitch Leader Keith Richmond talked about voter registration as the priority until the Democratic Presidential primary when the emphasis will switch to Get Out the Vote in flippable states of Colorado, Maine, Arizona, North Caroline and Iowa. Attached is a copy of the Teams’ slides on the action plan beginning in January, 2020. We are looking for someone who wants to lead Hawaii’s help in Arizona. Liz Miller from Volcano wants to focus on the two Senate races in Georgia. If you want to participate in the voter registration in flippable states in January, or if you have other ideas on how to support other candidates in 2020, please contact Younghee Overly [yoverly@gmail.com](mailto:yoverly@gmail.com). 


3. **Rural Caucus:** Indivisible National’s Rural Caucus conference call is scheduled for Nov 25th. Many of you will find this to be of great interest. Aftyn Behn, Organizer for Indivisible Kentucky will host the call.  We will post details shortly.


4. **Vote by Mail** while it is good that Hawaii will have Vote by Mail, current plans do not provide an adequate number of Voter Registration Centers or drop boxes. Common Cause Hawaii is doing an excellent job leading grassroots support and needs help to insure that Hawaii’s Vote by Mail process is executed effectively. Watch for more detailed information on this and action steps in a subsequent posting.
