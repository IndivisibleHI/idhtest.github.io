During the recess last week, Senator Schatz found time to meet with BlueWave team for a conversation about flipping U.S. Senate blue in 2020.  Key messages from the Senator were:
* You are a volunteer.. campaign for candidate(s) who inspire you!
* Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina would be his target as well
* Need to target four more and consider Georgia, Iowa, Kansas and Kentucky
* Senator is a big fan of Raphael Warnock, U.S. Senate candidate from Georgia

Senator volunteered to recruit volunteers for BlueWave, which of course means this meeting was a success for BlueWave team.
