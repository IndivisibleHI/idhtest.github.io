These protests started shortly after Trump was elected. The response has been overwhelmingly favorable.

Since Waikiki is a tourist area folks from many countries pass by. They don’t like Trump and often tell us they don’t understand how we could have elected him.  We didn’t but that is another story.

Trump supporters often tell us to get over it, get a job, have we been in the service {funny question since Trump is commonly known as bone spur Don or five deferment Don} and my answer is yes but Trump hasn’t. In the the beginning some told us to go back to Russia, that’s a funny one, but we haven’t heard that in a while. Many of his supporters make comments about the “Wall”. Our refrain has been, Who is going to pay for the wall, Mexico is going to pay to pay for the wall.”

For those on our side we are told we are doing God’s work, we are constantly thanked and many, many people want to take a picture of us and many join us for a photo.

Join us Wednesday evenings
