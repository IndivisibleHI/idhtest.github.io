The LGBTQIA\+ Rights Team addresses issues which may affect the LGBTQIA\+ community. The initiative was formed when Indivisible Hawaii realized that, despite current Hawaii statutes allowing for same sex marriage and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges recognizing the Constitutional right of same sex citizens to marry, Hawaii’s State Constitution still contains this language: “Section 23. The legislature shall have the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples.” Realizing this now-void language still exists woke our members up. The LGBTQIA\+ community faces increasing online harassment, hate crimes, and increasing discrimination. This team is working to fight that discrimination and preserve rights for the LGBTQIA\+ community.
