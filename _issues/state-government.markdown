Mission:  To work with the Hawaii State government to improve transparency and accountability on topics of interest to us

Legislature:  The Leg considers 3000-4000 bills each year, approximately half of which are duplicates.  The bills that are passed or killed each year are traded behind closed doors.  We need to reduce redundancy, improve transparency and accountability, and vote out the dead wood.

The Governor and Executive Agencies (by far the largest branch of government):   we need to encourage the Legislature to increase its oversight function of executive agencies to improve transparency and accountability and to reduce graft and corruption..   What are these agencies doing (or not doing) with our power and our money?

Focus topics:  voting/elections and ethics/transparency/accountability
