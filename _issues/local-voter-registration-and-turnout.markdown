Our mission is to assist unregistered voters in Hawaii to register

Our focus will be on reaching out to new young voters explaining the need to register to vote and assisting with digital registration.

The goal will be to increase progressive votes in 2024 at the state and federal level.

Partner organizations:\
We will be reaching out to League of Women Voters and will be working with e.g. Camryn Yussuf and other people in their 20s and 30s to reach as many young people as possible.
