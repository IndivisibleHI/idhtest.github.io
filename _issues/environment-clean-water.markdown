*** Over 53 million gallons of partially treated sewage leaches out of Hawai‘i's approximately 88,000 cesspools every day. 
* These outdated and inadequate wastewater systems leach nutrients, bacteria and other pathogens into groundwater and surface waterways, putting public health at risk and damaging coastal reef ecosystems.**
