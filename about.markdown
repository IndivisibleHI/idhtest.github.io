Indivisible Hawaii brings the Trump Resistance to nearly 400 of our closest neighbors on Oahu and through the Indivisible Hawaii Statewide Network chapters on Kauai, Maui (County) and the Big Island.

Indivisible Hawaii is a pro-democracy citizen activist group whose mission is to protect and enhance the institutions of democracy in our Country and our State.  We seek to resist the Trump agenda by engaging our elected officials at all levels of government and promote progressive and democratic values.

Indivisible Hawaii participates with the Indivisible National Distributed Fundraising program which is is a registered 501(c)(4)not-for-profit corporation. Contributions to Indivisible Hawaii through ActBlue are *not* tax-deductible, but we appreciate them anyway!

The Indivisible Hawaii Leadership Group is composed of organizers, tech specialists, and political gurus and helps guide Indivisible Hawaii on a path of productive and impactful action. Like everyone in our organization, Leadership Council members are all volunteers.

To contact the Leadership Council, please email info@indivisiblehawaii.org.
