Dear Berkeley community members,

At Indivisible Berkeley, our mission is to resist the Trump agenda and embody democratic and progressive values by engaging nonviolently with our political system. We are aware of plans for another White Supremacist and neo-Nazi "Free Speech" rally in Berkeley on August 27. We will update this post with more information on our plans for August 27 as it becomes available.

Stand Indivisible,

The Steering Team
