## Guest Speakers

Our guest speakers are from BHS Stop Harassing, Respect is Part of Research, and Equal Rights Advocates.

BHS Stop Harassing is a group of Berkeley High School students who are working to change the culture surrounding sexual harassment and violence at BHS and beyond. They want Berkeley High to be a model high school where all students feel safe and respected. They seek to spur district administrators and school decision-makers to immediately address shortcomings in the school environment that impede student success insofar as those factors create an unsafe learning environment.

Respect is Part of Research is a group of graduate students at Cal, based in the Physics Department, who organize peer training focused on preventing sexual harassment in academia.

Equal Rights Advocates is a national civil rights organization dedicated to protecting and expanding economic and educational access for women and girls.
