### T-Shirt Distribution

T-Shirts will be available for purchase between 7 and 7:30 PM, immediately before the GA, for $25 cash or $26 credit card. We have sizes ranging from small to 2XL and these shirts run large. We apologize in advance if we run out of the size you want. T-shirts will also be available for sale at the following General Assembly, on November 5.
