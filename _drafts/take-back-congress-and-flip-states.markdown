Why Michigan? Due to partisan gerrymandering, Republicans hold a drastically unfair advantage and are over-represented in the Michigan state legislature. Itâ€™s critical for Democrats to win seats in 2018 to make blue inroads in this presidential battleground state -- before 2020.  We'll be phoning for Democratic candidates Mallory McMorrow (running for State Senate) or Padma Kuppa (running for State House of Representatives).  We're working in partnership with Sister District

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP below, and we'll get back to you with more details!
