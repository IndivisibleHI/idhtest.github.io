### Overview
Earlier this year we encouraged our members to oppose EPA’s initial “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” regarding its intent to withdraw the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP).  Now EPA is requesting public comment on its proposed replacement for the CPP, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.
