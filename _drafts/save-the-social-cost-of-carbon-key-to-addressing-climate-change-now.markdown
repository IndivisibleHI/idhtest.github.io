call-script-text: "*Note:  It’s best to add to or modify the script below to personalize
  if possible. You could: 1) include specific effects of climate change that have
  affected you, loved ones or friends, 2) say what public health or environmental
  impacts concern you the most, and/or 3) mention impacts to future generations that
  you are concerned about.  \n\nHi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY,
  ZIP].  \n\nI am very concerned about the real consequences of human-caused climate
  change that I see in the communities around me - floods, fires, droughts and asthma
  and other health problems. Please oppose HR 3117, the so-called Transparency and
  Honesty in Energy Regulations Act.  HR 3117 would severely impede efforts to address
  climate change by reducing federal agencies’ abilities to consider the social cost
  of carbon when developing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The real
  social cost of carbon is critical to reducing climate impacts, and we cannot afford
  to wait to take strong action.  \n\nThank you for your time and attention.  \n\n[If
