### Action
Tell Governor Newsom to hold energy providers accountable for protecting the environment and ratepayers' interests.

### Talking Points
* Tell him how happy you are that your local electricity provider (East Bay
Community Energy [EBCE] or Marin Clean Energy [MCE]) is providing you with electricity that is cheaper and cleaner than that provided by PG&E.  
* Ask him to hold Commissioners of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) responsible for upholding the interests of ratepayers and the renewable energy goals of our state rather than the interests of the shareholders of PG&E. Or tell him to appoint new commissioners who will do so.  
* Ask him to urge the US Bankruptcy Court to appointment a Ratepayers Committee for PG&Eâ€™s bankruptcy case. This Committee could help PG&E reduce losses from past electricity procurements that we are still paying for even though we are no longer buying our electricity from PG&E.
