Tell Trump administration officials in person that you don't want them to drill for oil off the cost of California. Join the IB Science & Environment Team and the Center for Biological Diversity in Sacramento on Feb. 8 for the "listening session" and a pre-session protest.

We recommend you take the CBD bus from Oakland, available for a sliding-scale fee. If paying the fee is a challenge for you please let us know and we can help.
