Our General Assembly on September 10 was the first time we were back at the Finnish Hall for a GA since the end of June. The theme of the GA was "Summer Recap." We started with a half hour of team meet-and-greet, where community members could meet  IB Team members and learn what the teams are up to and how to get involved (hint: check out the [teams page](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/teams) on our website).

After everyone arrived, we kicked off the General Assembly with a sing-along to the gospel choir rendition of Lean On Me sung on Jimmy Fallon's show last week as part of a fundraiser for the communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. We'll definitely be singing again in future GAs!

The next section was much more serious: we discussed our community's response to the intense hate in the form of white supremacy that has visited Charlottesville, VA and our own city. We spent time discussing our reactions and ideas in groups of 3 or 4, then shared some highlights with the rest of the assembly. The discussion is not over, and we encourage the community to continue engaging on these issues even as we pursue our stated mission of civic engagement and political action.

Next up: the Summer Step-Up results. Many of our issue teams had major actions over the summer, and some had outright victories. Check out our [Successes page](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/successes) to see some of them for yourself. (Then go ahead and join a team!)
