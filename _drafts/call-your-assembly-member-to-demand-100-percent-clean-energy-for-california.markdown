  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I am calling to urge you to support SB 100. This bill will set the goal of powering California with 100% clean electricity by 2045 while creating jobs and improving health and well being in communities statewide. SB 100 passed in the Senate with the leadership of Senator Kevin de León. and now we need the Assembly to act!

  Thank you for your time and attention.
