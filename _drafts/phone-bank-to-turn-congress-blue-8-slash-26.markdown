But Harder is a strong candidate, and we can win this  -- IF we all work together to make it happen!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

**DATE:** Sunday, Aug 5, 1-4pm

**Location:** Near Cedar & Martin Luther King, Berkeley

**Please RSVP**, and we'll get back to you with more details --  Thank you!
