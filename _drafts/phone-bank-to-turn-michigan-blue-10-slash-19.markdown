We're partnering with Sister District CD-13 and phoning voters to support  Padma Kuppa or Mallory McMorrow, candidates for the State Legislature in Michigan, a Republican trifecta. The Michigan state legislature draws up district lines, and Michigan is heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. Help turn Michigan blue to protect voting rights and stop gerrymandering before 2020.  Help build blue power and a deep Democratic bench for the future!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP below, and we'll get back to you soon with more details!  Thanks much!
