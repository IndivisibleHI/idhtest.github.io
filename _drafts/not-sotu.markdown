Join Indivisible Berkeley in partnership with The Way Christian Center at our better-than-State of the Union viewing party!

We will watch a speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the connection between economic justice and racial justice.

Special thanks to Pastor Mike McBride for graciously allowing us to share his church's space.
