All over Berkeley Sunday night, IBers gathered, dined together and wrote postcards to Alabama. Altogether we had over 80 guests coming together to form a stronger community, and we wrote almost 500 postcards for [#DougJonesAL](https://dougjonesforsenate.com/). After a very hard week, this was just what we needed.

Next neighborhood dinner night will be in February or March.

In the meantime, here are some new memories from our 80+ guests spread out over 9 dinners!
