I'm hosting a phone bank for Cheryl Turpin (Virginia House of Delegates), on Saturday, Sept. 2nd from noon to 3.  Come relax in a hammock and do some phoning!  (Well, I only have two but do have plenty of chairs.)  I would love to see some fellow Electioneers at my house in central Berkeley. To sign up and get my address, click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_VTJYro3E3FgFrNNoKnc6AypEqo14Hjw14krn-L7aJwW6vA/viewform) [Check the box for "September 2, Turpin, 12-3 PM PT, W. Berkeley - near University and Sacramento"]

Bring a charged cell phone, a laptop or tablet, a pair of headphones/earbuds, and a charger. Hope to see you there!
