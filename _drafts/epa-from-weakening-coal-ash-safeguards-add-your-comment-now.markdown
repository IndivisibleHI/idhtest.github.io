call-script-text: "*Note: It’s best to add to or modify the script below to personalize,
  if possible or add details from the talking points in SaveEPA’s excellent guide,
  [Defending Health and Environmental Safeguards for Coal Ash Disposal](http://saveepaalums.info/coalash1),
  or the [joint Environmental Integrity Project/Sierra Club/Earth Justice guide](http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CCR-rollback-TPs.pdf).*\n\nCoal
  ash is an extremely toxic waste that presents serious risks to human health and
  the environment. It is known to have high levels of mercury, arsenic, lead and many
  other contaminants that contribute to cancer, asthma, heart disease, birth defects
  and neurological and brain damage.  Children - 1.5M of whom live near coal ash sites
  - are especially vulnerable.  Coal ash is responsible for the largest toxic waste
  disaster in U.S. history - 1.2B tons - in Kingston, Tennessee in 2008.  EPA’s own
  data show the widespread contamination of air, groundwater and surface water - including
  drinking water - resulting from the 1100 unlined and inadequately protected coal
  ash waste disposal sites in the U.S.  Leaks, air pollution and discharges from poorly
  regulated coal ash disposal disproportionately affect the most vulnerable disadvantaged
  communities and children.  \n\nEPA’s proposed revision would harm citizens in order
  to reduce modest responsibility for utilities.  It would do away with the most protective
  aspects of the rule by, for example,  allowing states, and even the utilities and
  impoundment operators, to set their own standards - which need not be health-based
  - and to decide when cleanup of a release is necessary.  This is an unacceptable
  dereliction of EPA’s responsibilities.  Every community deserves equal protection
  based on the best science, and EPA enforcement is the backbone of providing that
  protection.  Furthermore, communities deserve to know whether they are safe, so
  the existing rule’s requirement to publicly post compliance data should not be altered.
  \ Nor should the safer siting and management rules established in 2015 rule be changed.
  \ \n\nEPA cites the savings to utility companies in its rationale for the proposed
  changes. However, when determining the overall costs and benefits of this proposed
  rulemaking, EPA must also take into account the costs of lost lives, workdays and
  property due to coal ash releases and contaminated drinking water; medical care
  for those affected by contamination; and environmental cleanup costs in the same
  way all of these costs were evaluated under the original proposal.  \n\nThere is
  no basis in science or in cost/benefit analysis that justifies reducing the protections
  established under EPA’s 2015 rule.  EPA should not weaken those safeguards but maintain
  the rule in its current form.  The 2015 rule protects our citizens (especially vulnerable
  children) and our environment, and was supported by over half a million public comments."
