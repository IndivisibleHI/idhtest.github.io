Thanks for joining us on Sunday for the Indivisible Berkeley "One Year Till the Midterms" General Assembly! It was a great evening, which included presentations by Lisa Edwards from Representative Barbara Lee's office and Ashley Morris from ACLU NorCal.

The Indivisible Berkeley Elections Team pulled out all the stops, including a full dinner of pizza, salad and dessert (yum!). But more importantly, they prepared presentations from special guests and familiar faces about how we---as individuals in Berkeley---can contribute to winning back Congress in 2018.
