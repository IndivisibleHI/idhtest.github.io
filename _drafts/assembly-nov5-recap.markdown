Thanks for joining us on Sunday for the Indivisible Berkeley "One Year Till the Midterms" General Assembly! It was a great evening, which included presentations by Lisa Edwards from Representative Barbara Lee's office and Ashley Morris from ACLU NorCal.

The Indivisible Berkeley Elections Team pulled out all the stops, including a full dinner of pizza, salad and dessert (yum!). But more importantly, they prepared presentations from special guests and familiar faces about how we---as individuals in Berkeley---can contribute to winning back Congress in 2018.

*Lisa Edwards*, a staff member with Representative Barbara Lee, spoke about the importance of grassroots groups like ours in winning these electoral battles. A group of Northern California Congressional Democrats are putting together a grassroots conference through their PACs which will include a training component. If you have a suggestion, please email Lisa at [blee.campaign@gmail.com](mailto:blee.campaign@gmail.com) and CC us at [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org).

Lisa also mentioned her office accepts questions about the DNC.

*Ashley Morris*, an organizer with the ACLU of Northern California, introduced the ACLU's big campaign in California for 2018: same day registration. This program, now required in California, allows citizens to register to vote on the same day as an election, in the county elections office. Counties are allowed, but not required, to provide additional "Same Day Registration" (SDR) locations. The ACLU wants to make sure that SDR solves voter access problems faced by folks who might live too far from the DMV or county elections office to register in advance in the first place. So, they are campaigning to urge counties (including Alameda County) to set up SDR locations in many locations, particularly in neighborhoods or towns where the county does not already provide many voter access resources (such as DMVs and the county elections office).
