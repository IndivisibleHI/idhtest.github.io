Thanks for joining us on Sunday for the Indivisible Berkeley "One Year Till the Midterms" General Assembly! It was a great evening, which included presentations by Lisa Edwards from Representative Barbara Lee's office and Ashley Morris from ACLU NorCal.

The Indivisible Berkeley Elections Team pulled out all the stops, including a full dinner of pizza, salad and dessert (yum!). But more importantly, they prepared presentations from special guests and familiar faces about how we---as individuals in Berkeley---can contribute to winning back Congress in 2018.

*Lisa Edwards*, a staff member with Representative Barbara Lee, spoke about the importance of grassroots groups like ours in winning these electoral battles. A group of Northern California Congressional Democrats are putting together a grassroots conference through their PACs which will include a training component. If you have a suggestion, please email Lisa at [blee.campaign@gmail.com](mailto:blee.campaign@gmail.com) and CC us at [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org).
