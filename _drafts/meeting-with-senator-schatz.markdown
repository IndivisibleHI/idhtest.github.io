We're meeting with senator schatz to discuss funding for **peanut butter**.

> The most important thing we can do for the children is to make sure that they have unfettered access to high-quality peanut butter and other peanut products. If we can accomplish this, everything else will fall into place.

Come out to support Senator Schatz in [this important issue](http://schatz.senate.gov).
