Join us in calling voters in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District, where Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine veteran, is running again and has a good chance of winning against his hard-core right-wing opponent (of  “bathroom bill” infamy). This is an open special election -- the 2018 Republican winner’s “victory” was not certified because of massive fraud by his campaign, and the district has been without a representative since then. North Carolina is a potential 2020 swing state with 15 electoral votes -- a Democratic victory in this district will help the Democratic Party brand and build blue power in North Carolina!
