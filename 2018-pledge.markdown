# Pledge to make an impact on 2018 elections

### Canvass

Talk to voters in swing districts, learn about what they care about, and teach them how to be a committed voter in 2018. Canvassing is the gold standard for effective voter mobilization. Our Canvassing Captains, Billy and Jeff, have a great program set up for canvassing in **California's 10th Congressional District** (represented by Jeff Denham, R-*oh-God-get-him-out*) with community partners in Tracy and Turlock. You're invited to join Billy, Jeff and the whole canvassing squad on their twice-monthly canvassing day trips on Saturdays starting in January.

One of Indivisible Berkeley's election goals for 2018 is to contribute to the defeat of **Nevada** Senator Dean Heller (R-*Graham-Cassidy-Heller-all-hate-Obamacare*). Starting at the end of the summer or beginning of autumn, we'll be taking trips to Reno to help local groups get word out that it's time to pay attention and vote!

### Host a phone or text bank, or a postcard party

Build our community and mobilize voters at the same time by hosting a voter activation event at your home. Phone banks and text banks give us the opportunity for conversations with tens or hundreds of voters over just an hour or two (or three!) without going through the trouble of leaving Berkeley. And postcard parties are a little lower-stress since there's no live conversation with voters. But we hear stories of voters bringing their handwritten postcards to the polls when they vote, no matter where the postcard is sent from.
