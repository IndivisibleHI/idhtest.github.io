Indivisible Berkeley teams are semi-autonomous groups organized around specific issues such as healthcare, elections, or criminal justice reform. Team members plan events and actions which are open to the entire Indivisible Berkeley community. Any community member is welcome to attend a team event or action. All of the team's contact information is on the corresponding team page. (Note: not all teams have their own page yet. Our volunteers are busy but we're working on it!) To join a team, do one of these three things:

1. Subscribe to the team mailing list and/or Slack channel to see what the team is working on right now

2. Email the team leaders using at teamname+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org to find out how you can help

3. RSVP to and show up at a team event or team meeting to begin helping out right away!
