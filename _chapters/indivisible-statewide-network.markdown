INDIVISIBLE HAWAII STATEWIDE NETWORK


Across the country Indivisible chapters are stronger when chapters collaborate in state networks.  The Indivisible Hawaii Statewide Network seeks to collaborate with chapters on all islands to share best practices, tools and resources to focus on defeating Trump and Trumpism  in 2020. The Network is in its early planning stages and will provide updated information as actions and tools are clarified.
