Our V-CAN group organized after Trump became President in 2016. We initiated an outreach program where a range of elected officials and community leaders were invited as speakers to educate us about local and state politics and key issues of the times. We researched candidates for the US House and Senate on the state and national level whose values we supported, and in 2020 began writing Blue Wave letters and postcards to registered voters in battleground states to get out the vote. We continue that effort and joined the 2022 midterm effort to focus on registering young people to vote, which we are committed to continuing into the future.
