The North Hawaii Action Network is a group of Hawaii Island community members committed to protecting human rights, civil liberties, equality, and the health of our home planet. Formed in 2018, the advocacy and actions include sign-waving and protests, community meetings and issue advocacy with policymakers, and voter registration and mobilization locally and nationally.

In 2022 and 2023, NHAN organized community awareness sign-waving events for Reproductive Rights and Gun Sense and Safety in front of Ikaika Purdy statue, and members joined marches in support of these issues in Kona and Pa’auilo. Prior to elections in battleground states, we host events to write postcards to voters at ‘Ulu La’au Park. See the attached photos and see Facebook page.

While most activities are held in Waimea, participants drive from Kona and Hamakua to join in our activities and we welcome anyone to join us.
