Over 570 volunteers from Hawaii called, texted and wrote to register and turnout voters in swing states in 2020 and January 2021 to flip U.S. Senate and White House blue.  We will be calling, texting, writing and knocking on doors in 2022 to keep the U.S House and U.S. Senate blue.  

On Saturday July 30th 10AM HST, our U.S. Senator Brian Schatz will be our guest at the Indivisible Hawaii BlueWave 100 Day Sprint. You will learn about our target states, candidates you can support, and hear from volunteers from Hawaii who have been texting and writing postcards.  We will get you set up.  [Sign Up Here.

Let’s save ourselves, and of course, let’s save democracy. Bring a friend or two.
