team-description: We're going to Beat Trump, flip the U.S. Senate blue, and keep the
  U.S. House blue during the 2020 election to protect democracy.
---

**Goal**: 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue during the 2020 election.

**Philosophy**: We’re going to do the work to protect democracy.  We will support the Democratic Party’s nominees, whoever they are.  We will write, text, make calls, travel to swing states to knock on doors, and do whatever it takes.  

**January to September**: Join us to write letters to register new Democrats and to get registered Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina out to vote. 

Our BlueWave Person to Person letter writing is more important now. We will provide you the tools, training and materials to step up your letter writing from home. Starting March (until the situation with coronavirus is stablized), our group events will change to one at time (with CDC recommended social distance) exchange of new letters and materials, instructions and training to write letters from home. 

Option 1.  Learn how to get your own letters and write from home. Swing Left has comprehensive step by step training online - https://swingleft.org/writelettersfromhome 

Option 2. Come by to pick up new materials, sample letters and get training at a one person at time exchange at our previously scheduled meetings:

When we write, We Vote.
