team-description: We're going to Beat Trump, flip the U.S. Congress blue to protect
  our Democracy.
---

**Goal**: 38 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue during the 2020 election.

**Philosophy**: We’re going to do the work to protect democracy.  We will support the Democratic Party’s nominees, whoever they are.  We will write, text, make calls, travel to [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) to knock on doors, and do whatever it takes.  

**January to March**: We wrote letters, mailed voter registration forms, and wrote follow up postcards to 1300 potential new Democrats in Colorado and North Carolina to register to vote.

**April to July**: COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing and texting from home. We will write and text to registered Democrats in [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) to get them signed up to Vote by Mail. 

**August to October**: We will write, text, make calls to Get Out The Vote - details to be determined. We will also travel to [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) to knock on doors if traveling is possible by then.  Please e-mail natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you are interested in traveling to [swing states](https://swingleft.org/).

When we Vote, We Win.  
When we write, We Vote. 
When we Text, We Vote.
