Keep the Momentum.  Let's finish the Job.

It's not too early to get organized to keep the White House, Senate majority, and take back the House.   Look what Biden/Harris administration with Senate and House majority were able to do.  Dems lost House by 6675 votes in 2022 and we only need 5 more seats to Take Back the House in 2024.
