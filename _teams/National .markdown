Over 570 volunteers from Hawaii called, texted and wrote to register and turnout voters in swing states in 2020 and January 2021 to flip U.S. Senate and White House blue.  We will be calling, texting, writing and knocking on doors in 2022 to keep the U.S House and U.S. Senate blue.  

On Saturday May 14th NOON HST, PA Dems (Pennsylvania Democratic Party) is offering **Hawaii Exclusive Text Banking**. PA Dems will train you and experienced textbankers from the Indivisible Hawaii team will also be available to provide 1:1 support. We will then text to get Dems in Pennsylvania out to vote.
