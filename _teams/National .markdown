  the U.S. House Blue to protect democracy.

**Goal**: Beat Trump, flip the U.S. Senate blue, and keep the U.S. House blue during 2020 election.

**Philosophy**: We’re going to do the work to protect democracy.  We will support the Democratic Party’s nominees, whoever they are.  We will show up to write, text, make calls, travel to swing states to knock on doors, and do whatever it takes.
