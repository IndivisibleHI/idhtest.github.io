  our Democracy.  We grassroot volunteers kept U.S. Senate blue and almost kept U.S.
  House blue.  Let's Take Back the House in 2024.  Let's keep the White House and
  Senate blue in 2024.  Let's protect our Democracy, our earth, and our lives.\n\n"

Keep the Momentum.  Let's finish the Job.

It's not too early to get organized to keep the White House, Senate majority, and take back the House.   Look what Biden/Harris administration with Senate and House majority were able to do.  Dems lost House by 6675 votes in 2022 and we only need 5 more seats to Take Back the House in 2024.
