Over 570 volunteers from Hawaii called, texted and wrote to register and turnout voters in swing states in 2020 and January 2021 to flip U.S. Senate and White House blue.  We will be calling, texting, writing and knocking on doors in 2022 to keep the U.S House and U.S. Senate blue.  

Meanwhile [write postcards](https://postcards4va.com/) to keep Virginia blue.
