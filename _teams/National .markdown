**Goal**: 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue during the 2020 election.

**Philosophy**: We’re going to do the work to protect democracy.  We will support the Democratic Party’s nominees, whoever they are.  We will show up to write, text, make calls, travel to swing states to knock on doors, and do whatever it takes.  

**January to September**: Join us to write letters to register likely Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.
