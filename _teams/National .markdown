  AND KEEP THE U.S. HOUSE BLUE TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY. <b>"

**Goal**: flip the White House, flip the U.S. Senate, and keep the U.S. House blue

**Philosophy**: We’re going to do the work to protect democracy.  We will support the Democratic Party’s nominees, whoever they are.  We will show up to make calls, travel to flippable districts to knock doors, and do whatever it takes.
