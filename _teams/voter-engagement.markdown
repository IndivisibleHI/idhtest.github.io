When We Vote, We WIN.

Our goal is Massive Voter turnout for Progressive Democratic Candidates.

We engage our volunteers to support Voter Registration drives in Hawaii and other key states. We encourage all Citizens to participate in our Elections and vote for Progressive candidates. We are strategic in seeking out Citizens who likely will vote Progressive and who may not usually register or vote.

**January to September**: Join us to write letters to register new Democrats and to get Democrats out to vote in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina. 

Our BlueWave Person to Person letter writing is more important now. We will provide you the tools, training and materials to step up your letter writing from home. Starting March (until the situation with coronavirus is stablized), our group events will change to one at time (with CDC recommended social distance) exchange of new letters and materials, instructions and training to write letters from home. 

Step 1.  Learn how to get your own letters and write from home. Swing Left has comprehensive step by step training online - https://swingleft.org/writelettersfromhome 

Step 2. Come by to pick up new materials, sample letters and get training at a one person at time exchange at our previously scheduled meetings:

Every third Wednesdays 4:30PM to 7PM
Whole Foods - Back Patio, 629 Kailua Road Suite 100, Kailua 

Leeward Oahu
Every third Wednesdays 5PM to 7PM (House Party in Kapolei)
RSVP to natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org to get the direction to and address.  There will be space for 4-5 people to stay and write letters together with CDC recommended social distance.

Every third Saturdays 3:30PM to 5:30PM

Honolulu
Every last Sundays 6PM to 8PM (House Party in Kakaako)

Step 3: Email Gil at wevote20@gmail.com with any questions or concerns. 

Mahalo to all of you who together wrote 1300 letters to register new Democrats in Colorado and North Carolina.  They are stamped and mailed.  

**August to October**: We will meet to write, text, make calls to Get Out The Vote - details to be determined. We will also travel to swing states to knock on doors.  Please e-mail natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you are interested in traveling to swing states.

When we Vote, We Win.  
When we write, We Vote.
