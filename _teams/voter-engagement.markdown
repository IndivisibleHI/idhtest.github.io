When We Vote, We WIN.

Our goal is Massive Voter turnout for Progressive Democratic Candidates.

We engage our volunteers to support Voter Registration drives in Hawaii and other key states. We encourage all Citizens to participate in our Elections and vote for Progressive candidates. We are strategic in seeking out Citizens who likely will vote Progressive and who may not usually register or vote.

**January to September**: Join us to write letters to register likely Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina. 

Windward Oahu: every third Wednesday 5PM to 7PM 
               Down to Earth, inside cafe, 573 Kailua Rd, Kailua
Leeward Oahu: every third Thursday 5PM to 7PM
              e-mail natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org for the location
Honolulu: every third Saturday 3PM to 5PM 
          Democratic Party Hawaii HQ, 627 South St. Suite 105, Honolulu

**August to October**: We will meet to write, text, make calls to Get Out The Vote - details to be determined. We will travel to swing states to knock on doors.  E-mail voters+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you are interested in traveling to swing states.
