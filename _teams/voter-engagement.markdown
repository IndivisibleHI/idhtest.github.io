When We Vote, We WIN.

Our goal is Massive Voter turnout for Progressive Democratic Candidates.

We engage our volunteers to support Voter Registration drives in Hawaii and other key states. We encourage all Citizens to participate in our Elections and vote for Progressive candidates. We are strategic in seeking out Citizens who likely will vote Progressive and who may not usually register or vote.

**January to March**: We wrote letters, mailed voter registration forms, and wrote follow up postcards to 1300 potential new Democrats in Colorado and North Carolina to register to vote.

**April to July**: COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing and textbanking from home. We will write and text to registered Democrats in [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) to get them signed up to Vote by Mail. 

**August to October**: We will write, text, make calls to Get Out The Vote - details to be determined. We will also travel to [swing states](https://swingleft.org/) to knock on doors if traveling is possible by then.  Please e-mail natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you are interested in traveling to [swing states](https://swingleft.org/).

When we Vote, We Win.  
When we Write, We Vote. 
When we Text, We Vote.
