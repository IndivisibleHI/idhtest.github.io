When We Vote, We WIN.

Our goal is Massive Voter turnout for Progressive Democratic Candidates.

We engage our volunteers to support Voter Registration drives in Hawaii and other key states. We encourage all Citizens to participate in our Elections and vote for Progressive candidates. We are strategic in seeking out Citizens who likely will vote Progressive and who may not usually register or vote.

**January to March**: We wrote to 1300 potential new Democrats in Colorado and North Carolina to register to vote.

**April to July**: COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing from home. We will write to registered Democrats in swing states to get them signed up to Vote by Mail. 

So far, we have an online training scheduled for Wednesday March 25th 5PM to 6PM and Sunday April 5th 5PM to 6PM.  

Option 1: Join Online from your laptop, PC, iPad or smartphone

Join at 4:30PM if this is first time you are using zoom to make sure you are setup OR contact Younghee at natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org to setup before March 25th.  

Option 2: Join by Calling In (option 1 is recommended since we will be showing you screens)

Please contact Gil at wevote20@gmail.com for one-on-one training if you cannot make to training on March 25th nor April 5th.

**August to October**: We will write, text, make calls to Get Out The Vote - details to be determined. We will also travel to swing states to knock on doors if traveling is possible by then.  Please e-mail natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you are interested in traveling to swing states.

When we Vote, We Win.  
When we write, We Vote.
