Indivisible is a national grassroots movement formed in December 2016 to defeat the Trump agenda of racism, misogyny and authoritarianism. There are now thousands of local Indivisible groups across the county representing over a million people. In Hawai ªi, we have seven chapters across four islands representing over a thousand pro-democracy citizens.
