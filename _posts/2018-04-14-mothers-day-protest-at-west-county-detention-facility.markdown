Join the community circle to protest at Richmond's West County Detention Center (WCDF)! Those detained in our midst are our loved ones, neighbors, co-workers, and classmates. The impact of these racist, cruel separations has enormous economic and social impact on our communities. And the same is true for the general population in jail, who are also unfairly criminalized and detained for lengthy periods before trial.

Presenters and artists to be announced - check the [event Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/2124387234244989/) for updates.
