Wanted to share a couple of Ray Markey's thoughtful articles with all of you. 

[Trump, Fascism and the Allure of Authoritarianism](https://www.thenewcrossroads.com/2020/09/30/trump-fascism-and-the-allure-of-authoritarianism/)

Given what is happening in Michigan, this is very timely.

From Judith Goldman, Indivisible Hawaii member. 
"This is such a detailed clear history and analysis of what we are facing. It’s terrifying, and it’s a hit over the head to be even more active in getting out the voters in theses final days."

[Why the Left Should Support the anti-Trump Lincoln Project](https://www.thenewcrossroads.com/2020/08/25/why-the-left-should-support-the-anti-trump-lincoln-project/)
