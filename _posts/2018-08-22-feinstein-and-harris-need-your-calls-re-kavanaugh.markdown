call-script-text: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY].\n\nI am
  calling to support the Senator’s position opposing the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh
  to the Supreme Court.  Confirming him would be one of the most damaging long-term
  actions of this administration.  His record clearly shows that his positions on
  climate action, environmental protection, a woman’s right to choose, health care,
  and LGBTQ rights are highly conservative, and that he will put corporate interests
  above the public’s interests.  His positions show that he cannot be counted on to
  hold the president accountable.  The rule of law and the principles of our democracy
  are at stake.  I support your every effort to oppose his nomination and to persuade
  waivering Democratic senators to oppose him as well.   \n\nThank you for your hard
  work answering the phones.\n\n[IF LEAVING A VOICEMAIL: please leave your full street
  address to ensure your call is tallied]"

### Action
We have learned from Senator Feinstein’s state director that, although Feinstein opposes the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, she is not receiving many calls in support of her position.  Please call both our senators as often as possible - every day if you can - to reinforce their opposition and their efforts to persuade wavering Democrats in Trump-aligned states.
