call-script-text: "Hello, my name is [name] and I'm a constituent calling from Berkeley.
  Thank you for your leadership in taking steps to end the divisive and harmful Urban
  Shield program. Now is the chance for Alameda County to proactively design and implement
  disaster preparedness programs that are effective, humane, and community-centered.
  The recommendations that have been approved by the Ad Hoc Committee are a much needed
  step in the right direction. These include: \n\n  -  Eliminating SWAT teams and
  competition from the exercises\n  -  Eliminating the weapons expo that puts weapons
  manufacturers and private interests above the goals of whole community preparedness\n
  \ -  Dedicating resources for the Public Health Department to conduct emergency
  preparedness exercises.\n  -  Getting rid of the notoriously toxic Urban Shield
  label\n\nI urge you to continue to embody strong leadership for the county’s communities,
  and to give Alameda County residents the resources they deserve by voting to adopt
  the Ad Hoc Committee’s recommendations during your meeting on February 26th."
