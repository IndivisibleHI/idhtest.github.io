Pick your worst nightmare of the Trump Administration. Now imagine 1460 more days of the Trump Administration.  

READY to Call/Text/Write to 10 left leaning infrequent voters in a swing state per day?Â READY to dedicate few hours of your time per week for Joe & Kamala and to flip the U.S. Senate blue? Using "Shut Up and Write" structure which writers effectively used for years, we will zoom and then call/text/write to the voters in swing states.  We will also provide **training to phonebank** to Arizona and North Carolina, and **set you up to write** letters & postcards.  

You must **[register/RSVP](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZArduGvrjIvHtJMFgItBYBfZcrhY6Qi7Ca0)** to receive zoom information and instruction.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
