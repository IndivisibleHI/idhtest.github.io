We turned out in record numbers to pick Joe and Kamala who will care and govern for all Americans.  Now it is time to turnout voters in Georgia to flip U.S. Senate blue. Georgia is the Ground Zero.  

In Georgia, in order to win, a candidate must earn more than 50% of the votes. Because neither U.S. Senate races met this requirement during the November 3rd election, we now have two January 5th runoff elections. One between Jon Ossoff (D) and incumbent David Perdue (R), and one between Raphael Warnock (D) and incumbent Kelly Loefflor (R).  By turning out votes for Ossoff and Warnock, we can have 50-50 in U.S. Senate.  

HERE IS HOW YOU CAN HELP.

* **[DONATE](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/georgiasenate):**  Donate at www.gasenate.com and your donation will be split between [Ossoff](https://electjon.com/) campaign, [Warnock](https://warnockforgeorgia.com/) campaign, and Stacey Abram's [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/).  Republicans will likely spend half billion between two races.
