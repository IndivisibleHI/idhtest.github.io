Join us for the next Immigration Team meeting! We'll talk about how we can support the work that's going on to protect immigrants here in the Bay Area, prepare for Sunday's [protest at the West County Detention Facility](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/event/august-protest-at-west-county-detention-facility), and talk with an Elections Team representative about how we can help flip Congress to fight back against the administration's cruel anti-immigrant policies.

Location: Near the intersection of the Ohlone Greenway and Neilson Street. **Please RSVP for address!**
