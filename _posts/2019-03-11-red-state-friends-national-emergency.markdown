Ask friends, family, and colleagues in other states to call their senators to support the Senate action (HJR 46) overturning Trumpâ€™s Border State of Emergency declaration.

The resolution to revoke the emergency declaration, having passed the House, is coming to a head this week in the Senate. That vote could be scheduled any time this week, with a deadline of Friday.

We're now asking IB members to contact friends or relatives in other states to ask them to call their senators and urge them to vote in favor of the joint resolution. We need your leadership on this action and your help in encouraging other IB members to make calls.

See [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bxvIrQxZ2wet1z4sn46XPIFz9VF7SroP_HOGoRKQ4NY/edit#gid=847409716) for the most important Senators to call (in green and yellow).

### Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-ffFEf2NufWE_q79svQPbMKRLdmT2D1Cr7AqSL90u_8/edit) to commit to calling your friends!

Let's do this.
