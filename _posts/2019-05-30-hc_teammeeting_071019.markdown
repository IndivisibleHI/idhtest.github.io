Our [Health Care Forum 2019](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/event/general-assembly-may) was a great success. Yasmin Peled presented California Health Care legislative progress in 2018, through the Care4All California legislative agenda for 2019 with clarity and full audience engagement. In case you missed it, here is a link to her presentation:

Yasmin included actions: writing to our Assembly member and state Senator asking them to support key health care bills. Our Team page has links to these and further actions with deadlines in June:
