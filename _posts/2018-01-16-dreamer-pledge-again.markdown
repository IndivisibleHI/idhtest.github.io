  Call script adapted from [Indivisible National](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/thank-moc-voting-fight-alongside-dreamers/)

  **You**: Hello! My name is <your name> and I’m calling from Berkeley. I wanted to thank [Congresswoman / Senator] <her name> for voting against the CR that didn’t include the Dream Act. Dreamers deserve MoCs who will stand with them and use their power to protect them from the Trump deportation machine, and I am proud that [Congresswoman / Senator] used her power to do so. Please also fight for legislation protecting recipients of TPS.

  Staffer: It’s great to hear that from you; I’ll be sure to pass along your gratitude to the [Congresswoman / Senator].

  **You**: Just one more thing—I also want the [Congresswoman / Senator] to know that I expect her to continue voting at every opportunity to stand with Dreamers in the new year. There will be more critical bills that require bipartisan support to pass early next year—such as another CR in January—and [Congresswoman / Senator] <her name> should continue to demand that the Dream Act be attached to those bills as a condition for her vote.

  Staffer: I’ll pass along your thoughts to the [Congresswoman / Senator].

  **You**: Yes please do, and thank you as well. We appreciate the [Congresswoman / Senator]’s staff just as much as we appreciate her.
