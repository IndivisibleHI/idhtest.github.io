  Call script adapted from [Indivisible National](https://www.dreamerpledge.org/dream-hero-call-script/)

  **You**: Hello! My name is ___ and I’m calling from Berkeley. I wanted to thank [Congresswoman / Senator] ___ for voting against the CR that didn’t include the Dream Act or protection for TPS recipients. Dreamers deserve Members of Congress who will stand with them and use their power to protect them from the Trump deportation machine, and I am proud that [Congresswoman / Senator] ___ used her power to do so.

  Staffer: It’s great to hear that from you; I’ll be sure to pass along your gratitude to the [Congresswoman / Senator].

  **You**: Also, I consider this “deal” to be a failure of Democratic leadership, and I expect [Senator / Congresswoman] ____ will work to ensure that the caucus stays strong in its convictions and votes to protect Dreamers.

## Every day, 122 DREAMers lose their legal protection.

Call all three of our Members of Congress (MoCs) and ask them to stand strong in support of the DREAMers and recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). On January 22, Senate Democrats caved and voted for a short-term spending deal with no protections for immigrants - leaving 700,000 DREAMers and more than 250,000 TPS recipients from El Salvador, Haiti, and other countries at risk of imminently losing their legal status.

Please thank our Members of Congress for standing up for immigrants, and let them know we need them to keep fighting!
