  Call script adapted from [Indivisible National](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/thank-moc-voting-fight-alongside-dreamers/)

  **You**: Hello! My name is <your name> and I’m calling from Berkeley. I want the [Congresswoman / Senator] to vote "No" on any CR this week that does not include the Dream Act. The bipartisan deal reached last week contains the Dream Act and it is a travesty that the Republicans are holding our government hostage over a deal that's already been made. [Congresswoman / Senator] <her name> should continue to demand that the Dream Act be attached to the CR as a condition for her vote.

  Staffer: I’ll pass along your thoughts to the [Congresswoman / Senator].

  **You**: Yes please do, and thank you.

## DACA is still at risk. We can save it this week.

Call all three of our Members of Congress (MoCs) and ask them to stand strong in support of the DREAMers. A bipartisan deal was reached last week to protect the DREAMers and continue funding the government. The only thing standing in its way is Trump and the GOP immigration hard-liners.

_We must push for this successful bipartisan deal to become law!_
