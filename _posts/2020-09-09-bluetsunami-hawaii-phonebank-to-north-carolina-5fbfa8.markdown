Trump won North Carolina in 2016 by only 3.8% and Joe is currently leading by 1.8%. Yeah we can win in this southern state this election!

This one is a 5'fer - Joe/Kamala for White House, Cal Cunningham for U.S. Senate, Re-elect NC Governor Roy Cooper for NC Governor, Re-elect Chief Justice Cheri Beasley (the first African American woman in NC Supreme Court), and for Democratic candidates for NC State Senate and NC State House.

You ** [must RSVP](https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/event/320868/)** to receive zoom information and instruction.

Agenda (times in Hawaii time which is 6 hours behind NC time):
* 11AM Training
* 11:30PM Phonebank
