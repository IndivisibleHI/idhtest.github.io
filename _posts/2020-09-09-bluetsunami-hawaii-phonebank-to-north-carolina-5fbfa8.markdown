Trump won North Carolina in 2016 by only 3.8% and Joe is currently leading by 1.8%. Yeah let's turnout votes for Joe/Kamala so we can win in this southern state this election!

This one is a 4'fer - Joe/Kamala for White House, Cal Cunningham for U.S. Senate, Re-elect NC Governor Roy Cooper for NC Governor, and Re-elect Chief Justice Cheri Beasley (the first African American woman in NC Supreme Court).

You ** [must register/RSVP](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMlce-vrDwqG93LGlpMbG0ViIU8jeur1adv) ** to receive zoom information and instruction.

Agenda (times in Hawaii time which is 6 hours behind NC time):
* 11AM Training
* 11:30PM Phonebank
* 12:45PM Debrief
* 1PM Close

Don’t worry if you’ve never done something like this before. We’ll train you, provide a phone script and a list of voters to call.  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J9vREXbXlM&feature=youtu.be) to hear from other volunteers.

You’ll need a **phone and a laptop computer or tablet** to make calls.
