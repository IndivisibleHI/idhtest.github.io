POST CARD PARTIES! Come join IB members to write GOTV postcards to voters in CD10. Dates are three Saturdays and one Sunday in September: Saturdays, September 8, 15, and 29, and Sunday, September 23. Time is 10:00 to 12:00 and location is the home of Anne Fitzmaurice in southwest Berkeley. 

We will provide postcards, postage, addresses, and suggestions for what to write as well as snacks. We’ll also take care of mailing the cards after they’re written. If you can bring a clip board and a contribution for postage that would be great. Also needed are 4 or 5 folding chairs. RSVP to annefitzmaurice@lmi.net and she will email you the address and phone number.
