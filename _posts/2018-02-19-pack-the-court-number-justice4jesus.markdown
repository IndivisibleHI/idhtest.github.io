Free Jesús! The California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance (CIYJA) isadvocating for Jesús,an outstanding father, partner, and community member. At his hearing last week, the judge refused to hear witnesses in his defense. His attorneys filed a motion noting due process violations and he has a new hearing on this date with a new judge.

**IMPORTANT TO KNOW:**

* Arrive promptly so we can go into the courthouse together, even though hearings are scheduled to start 30 minutes after the times shown.

* Let the security guard know whose bond hearing you are attending.

* If you have a valid photo ID (driver's license, etc.), please bring it. If you do not, you may ask for an escort to the courtroom.

* Do NOT bring signs (they will be confiscated) or wear movement shirts/attire—our role is to show the judge that the person being detained has the support of the community, simply by our presence in the back of the courtroom. We cannot participate in or be seen as disrupting the proceedings in any way. Thank you for your support!
