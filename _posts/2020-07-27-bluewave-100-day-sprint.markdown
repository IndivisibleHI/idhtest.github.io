1290 days since Trump took office, [pick your worst nightmare of the Trump Administration].  Now imagine 1460 more days of the Trump Administration. 

94 days to go until the election day of our life time.  Be ready to SHARE YOUR ACTIONS to **dump Trump** and **flip the U.S. Senate blue**. For details on suggested actions, click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEV7GyCCdD9N_IKkHcmukllmfeL-3IzMcNRak0ULtpKoGlkg/viewform). Also, share with participants, one sentence telling us why you think this is important. Just 2 hours a week will let you reach out to a lot of people in key states. We can do this!
