We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to Beat Trump and to Flip U.S. Congress Blue during the 2020 election.

Join us to write letters to register new Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.

We will provide names & addresses, letters, voter registration forms, stamps, and the training. You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters. We welcome donation of 55 cents stamps and/or cash.

Please RSVP so we can inform you of location where we will meet for this letter writing house party on Queens Street.
