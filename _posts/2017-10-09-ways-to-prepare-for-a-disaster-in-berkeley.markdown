At the General Assembly last Sunday, we heard from IBer Dave Peattie about how each of us can prepare for a disaster in Berkeley such as an earthquake, wildfire or landslide. Here are some resources Dave suggests you check out.

#### Berkeley Disaster Prep Neighborhood Network

[www.BDPNNetwork.org](www.BDPNNetwork.org)

Our Mission is to assist Berkeley households and neighborhoods to respond effectively to disasters by further developing organizational skills, human and material resources, and responsiveness by sharing experiences, seeking expert advice, enhanced training and information sharing.

#### CERT: Community Emergency Response Training

[https://www.cityofberkeley.info/certclassschedule/](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/certclassschedule/)

The City of Berkeley offers trainings roughly once per month which cover topics such as how to use a crowbar to rescue someone under a collapsed house, how to put out a fire (and how to decide if you need to call 911), disaster first aid, and more.

#### Alameda County alert system

You can customize to receive different kinds of alerts in different ways such as email, text message, or phone call.

#### United Policyholders (insurance advice)

[http://www.uphelp.org/](http://www.uphelp.org/) (specific Earthquake insurance page is [here](http://www.uphelp.org/library/guides/earthquake-insurance))
