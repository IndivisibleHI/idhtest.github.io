Did you know that Dems lost U.S. House by 6675 votes?  

The point being: WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE- EVERY VOTE COUNTS!

Join us to write postcards to register left leaning voters in swing states NOW to WIN 2024!  Let's save democracy.  Let's protect our freedom.

**Where: Punaluʻu Bake Shop**, upper pavillion, Nāʻālehu

We will provide postcards, names, instructions, etc  and will have postcards to take home + info on texts, calls & other actions. Bring family and friends.

If you can’t attend & but are interested, email us at natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org.
