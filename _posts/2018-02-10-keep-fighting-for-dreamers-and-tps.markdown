call-script-text: "Caller: Hi! My name is [name] and I live in [part of state]. I'm
  calling to thank [MoC] for standing up for Dreamers and ask her to keep working
  to pass a clean Dream Act and provide protection for TPS recipients, now. 122 Dreamers
  have been losing their DACA protections every day since Trump announced the end
  of the program back in September, and starting on March 5 that number will rise
  to over 1,200 a day. By failing to act, Congress is letting Trump and his deportation
  force enact the administration's white supremacist agenda.\n\nStaffer: Thanks for
  calling. The [House / Senate] will be voting on immigration legislation soon that
  will include provisions to protect Dreamers.\n\nCaller: Congress must keep the promise
  that we made to Dreamers when DACA was first started by voting to permanently protect
  them from deportation. We also need to ensure that TPS recipients from El Salvador,
  Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan are protected as part of any immigration deal. \n\nStaffer:
  I'll pass your thoughts along to [MoC].\n\nCaller: Please do, and please take down
  my contact information so you can let me know what [MoC] decides to do."

### [What's Next in the Fight to Protect Dreamers](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/whats-next-fight-protect-dreamers/)
(via Indivisible National)

The fight for Dreamers isn’t over, but the path forward is highly uncertain. Negotiations have taken a dramatic turn to the right, and the proposals that are likeliest to move in Congress are ones that progressives and immigration groups can’t accept.

It’s difficult to hear, especially if you’re a Dreamer, but the hard truth is that passing the Dream Act before the March 5 deadline is unlikely. Immigration hardliners in Congress — and in the White House — are trying to use DACA as a bargaining chip to make extreme changes to our immigration system, and to make it easier to tear apart immigrant families.  Here’s what you need to know about the fight over Dreamers.

### THE AFTERMATH OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS
On Jan. 19, Democrats took a stand to defend Dreamers when they voted against a temporary funding bill that did not include permanent protections for Dreamers. Unfortunately, Democrats voted just three days later to fund the government temporarily until Feb. 8 without securing relief for Dreamers. 

Democrats again had leverage on the February 8 CR.  This time around, it really mattered in the House. Republicans lost votes from their own side in the Freedom Caucus, and as a result, Democratic votes were needed to pass the CR in the House, giving Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats the most leverage they’ve ever had in this fight. But this time around, Nancy Pelosi couldn’t seem to whip enough votes to the block the CR from passing. That means another temporary government funding bill has passed that fails to provide Dreamers permanent protection from Deportation.

Get ready for a possible defensive fight over the Dream Act. Up next in the Senate? Standalone immigration bills, which are a risky proposition in this Congress. Conservative Republicans are pouncing on the opportunity to work on immigration and have proposed several nativist bills, demanding that they receive a vote. It appears that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are allowing Republicans to pursue an immigration bill that is separate from government spending bills. This all but ensures that the final package will be an extreme, enforcement-heavy proposal that immigrant rights organizations will oppose.

This means that instead of getting a narrow, reasonable DACA fix, we could find ourselves trying to stop an anti-immigrant bill from getting through Congress. It’s still too early to tell, but this is likelier at this point than the Dream Act we all want.

The [McCain-Coons proposal](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/immigration/ct-senate-bipartisan-immigration-plan-20180205-story.html) is helpful in that it actually seeks to address the DACA crisis, and highlights just how extreme the alternative proposals are, but it is unlikely to move in this Republican-controlled Congress. Despite what you might be hearing, the negotiations in Congress have stalled. In fact, negotiations have steadily deteriorated since the bipartisan deal reached by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) back in December. Most of the current proposals go beyond the DACA fix we need and add anti-immigrant provisions more consistent with the White House’s framework. Those conservative proposals would empower ICE and other immigration officials to more quickly remove and jail immigrants, effectively requiring that Dreamers sacrifice the safety of their parents. It is too high a price to pay.   

### WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP DREAMERS
It’s possible that we could get a breakthrough in Congress, especially as we approach the arbitrary March 5 deadline, when the number of DACA recipients losing their protections will skyrocket from 122 to 1,200 a day. If that happens, Indivisible groups need to be ready to pressure their Members of Congress to make sure we get a DACA fix that is consistent with our values and that doesn’t require Dreamers to sacrifice their parents in the process. 

This means:
1. Continuing to demand a clean DREAM Act, using the call script on this page; and 
2. [Being an immigrant ally locally](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/immigrant-ally-toolkit-introduction/): This means showing up at "Pack the Court" events, getting trained as a rapid responder, and ensuring local law enforcement isn't collaborating with ICE and Trump's deportation agenda.
