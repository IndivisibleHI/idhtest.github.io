  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I am calling to urge the Senator to oppose Kathleen Harnett White to head the Council on Environmental Quality, Barry Lee Myers to lead NOAA, Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy Administrator for EPA, Bill Wehrum to head EPA’s Air Programs, Michael Dourson to head EPA’s Chemical Safety Programs, Matthew Leopold for EPA’s Top Legal Advisor, and Susan Parker Bodine for EPA’s Top Enforcement Role. The Trump administration continues its attempt to fill federal agencies and departments with leaders whose interests and experiences lie, not in science-driven protections for the public, but in promoting the interests of powerful polluting industries. Among these nominees, there are none with strong public health, science and environmental protection credentials, who will put facts and the public first.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

### Background

The Trump administration continues its attempt to fill federal agencies and departments with leaders whose interests and experiences lie, not in science-driven protections for the public, but in promoting the interests of powerful polluting industries.  In total, the nominees listed below represent an unparalleled action to place  industries in power throughout government. Among these nominees, there are none with strong public health, science and environmental protection credentials, who will put facts and the public first. 

Hearings may be held at any time, so please call or write now.

**Kathleen Harnett White to head the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ)** - As someone who has called CO2 “harmless” and renewable energy “unreliable and parasitic,” she should not be appointed as senior environmental advisor to the White House.  She says it is “absurd” to call CO2 a pollutant, that climate change has “little to do with science,” and that science does not dictate policy in democracies.  
 
**Barry Lee Myers to lead NOAA** – As CEO of a private weather service, Accuweather, he has a conflict of interest, and as a non-scientist he has no experience with NOAA’s vast responsibilities related to oceans, fisheries and coastlines.  He has clashed with NOAA about what he called unfair competition.  Critics are concerned that he will use his position for competitive advantage and minimize the National Weather Service’s role.  
 
**Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy Administrator for EPA** – Wheeler is a lobbyist for the giant Murray Energy coal company and was a senior aide to Senator Inhofe, a strong critic of EPA who denies climate change
 
**Bill Wehrum to head EPA’s Air Programs** - He is a corporate attorney who represents coal, oil, gas and chemical companies and trade associations that oppose EPA clean air rules.  In a previous EPA role he was instrumental in evading the Agency’s regulatory responsibilities which resulted, according to NRDC,  in EPA’s “allowing more illegal emissions of harmful air pollution than any EPA administration before or since.”
 
**Michael Dourson to head EPA’s Chemical Safety Programs** - As head of a chemical industry consulting firm that has routinely fought limits on toxic chemical emissions, he is unsuited to oversee the regulation of chemicals made by the companies he has represented.  
 
**Matthew Leopold for EPA’s Top Legal Advisor** – He has stated that EPA overstepped in issuing the Clean Power Plan, and has pushed for turning more environmental authority over to states. He has advocated for Congress to ratify any new regulation – making a public health decision that should be based on science into a political one.  He represents chemical, mining and other industries.  He is accused of minimizing enforcement as legal counsel for the Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, and he supported the governor in cutting a third of environmental regulations.
 
**Susan Parker Bodine for EPA’s Top Enforcement Role** - Her history representing companies that are directly affected by EPA cleanup rules, including the American Forest and Paper Association, whose member companies have hundreds of EPA enforcement actions against them - including actions to clean up Superfund sites - make her a compromised choice for the lead enforcement role.
