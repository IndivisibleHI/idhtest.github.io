### Suggested Comment
*Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].*  

*I am very concerned about climate change. We in California are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate change.*  

*The transportation sector is the greatest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in our state.*  

*Increasing ownership of zero emissions electric vehicles is crucial for California if we are to meet our mandated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. It is for this reason that I am asking you to co-sponsor the recently introduced Driving America Forward Act. This bill would increase the number of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) buyers eligible for a federal tax credit by 400,000 for each automaker.*  

*Tax credits are a big incentive for potential buyers of plug in electric vehicles (PEVs). This bill (S1094 / HR 2256) would be especially advantageous for Californians because we lead the country in PEV purchases and they are becoming even more popular in our state.  Californians purchase almost as many EVs annually as all other states combined. It is important that California continues to lead in the battle against climate change. This bill would help to accelerate the movement away from fossil fuels in the transportation sector and allow  California to continue to serve as a model for change.*  

*Thank you for your time and attention.*

### Background
The Senate bill (S1094) titled Driving America Forward Act was introduced on 4/10/19 by  Democrat Debbie Stabenow (MI) with cosponsors: Democrat G. Peters (MI) and two Republicans, L. Alexander (TN) and S. Collins (ME). An identical House bill (HR 2256) was introduced by Democrat D. Kildee (MI) shortly after. The bipartisan sponsorship is important for garnering the support necessary for passing these bills.  

California’s future plans for slashing carbon emissions depend heavily on replacing gasoline and diesel vehicles with EVs. The transportation sector accounts for nearly 40% of the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. If California is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 as required by SB 32 we must get more PEVs on the road.  

Jerry Brown set a goal of 5 million ZEVs registered in California by 2030. SF Assemblyman Phil Ting is pushing for even more. By the end of November 2018 over 500,000 EVs had been sold in California.  

Tax credits for EVs are a big incentive for many people. The current $7500 federal tax credit available to the first 200,000 purchasers of a new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle (PEV) from each automaker has already been fully used by Tesla and GM customers. There is no doubt that the new credit of $7000 per PEV available to the next 400,000 purchasers will be a strong incentive for new buyers.
