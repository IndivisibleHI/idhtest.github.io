JUST A FEW WEEKS TO GO BEFORE THE NOV 5TH VIRGINIA ELECTION!

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. **We can help turn Virginia Blue by flipping just one more seat in Virginia**. We write. We Vote. We WIN!
 
We’ll meet in the new Kailua Down To Earth (formerly Macy’s) - inside, on the street side of the building.
