**Please join Indivisible Hawaii for a zoom presentation by Eileen Reavey, the National Grassroots Coordinator of National Popular Vote.**

**You won't want to miss this session!**

**What is the National Popular Vote?**

* **The national popular vote winner should become President**
* **One-person, one-vote**
* **Candidates should have a reason to campaign in all 50 states**

The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC) has passed in 15 states (including Hawaii!) and DC representing 196 Electors. When the states in the Compact represent 270 or more electoral votes, all of their electoral votes will be given to the candidate who wins the national popular vote.

We need additional state legislatures to pass NPVIC representing at least 74 additional Electors to reach 270. We need this as soon as possible, but certainly by early 2024. If we can make this happen, the next U.S. President will be the person who gets the majority of the votes across the country, by definition. No amendments to the Constitution are required!

**Find out:**

* A summary of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact agreement

* Which states have the possibility of joining NPVIC in 2021, with activists' help?

* What is the status in those states?

* How can Hawaii residents help?

* Questions and answers
