Join us to watch the results of the Super Tuesday state primaries and caucuses for the Democratic Presidential nomination.

More delegates to the presidential nominating convention will be won on Super Tuesday than on any single day. Fourteen state primaries and the American Samoa caucuses will take place, amounting to 1,344 pledged delegates - 33.8% of the nationwide total.

These contests typically represent a presidential candidate's first test of national electability. Candidates must therefore do well on this day to help secure their party's nomination. Convincing wins in Super Tuesday primaries have usually propelled candidates to their party's nomination.
