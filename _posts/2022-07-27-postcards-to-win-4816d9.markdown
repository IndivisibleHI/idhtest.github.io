Join Indivisible Hawaii postcard writing team to get all the training and tools to write powerful, personal postcards to democratic voters in key swing state elections. Our postcards programs have proven success in reaching out to low propensity democratic voters who will decide the midterms. Work with other postcard writers to share your best practices and words that win.
