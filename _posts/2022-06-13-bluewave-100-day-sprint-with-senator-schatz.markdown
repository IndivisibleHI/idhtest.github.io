Ready to Win again?  Do you have an hour or two a week you can volunteer to keep U.S. Congress blue this mid-term election?

On Saturday July 30th 10AM HST, our U.S. Senator Brian Schatz will be our guest at the Indivisible Hawaii BlueWave 100 Day Sprint to cheer us on and to answer our questions.  We will get you set up to text and write to left leaning voters in swing states.  

Let's save ourselves, and of course, let's save democracy. Bring a friend or two.
