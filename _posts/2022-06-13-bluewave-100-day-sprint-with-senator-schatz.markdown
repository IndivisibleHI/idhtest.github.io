Are you worried that so many Trump backed candidates are winning the primaries in swing states?  Are you worried about attack on our democracy? our reproductive rights? What can you do?  Register left leaning voters and get Dems out to vote this election!  

On Saturday July 30th 10AM HST, our U.S. Senator Brian Schatz will be our guest at the Indivisible Hawaii BlueWave 100 Day Sprint. You will learn about our target states, candidates you can support, and hear from volunteers from Hawaii who have been texting and writing postcards.  We will get you set up.  

Let's save ourselves, and of course, let's save democracy. Bring a friend or two.
