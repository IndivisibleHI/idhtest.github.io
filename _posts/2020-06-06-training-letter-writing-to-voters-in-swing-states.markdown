COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **defeat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  Ohioans voted by mail on April 28th and for the first time since 2008, more Democrats than Republicans voted in an Ohio presidential primary.  Unfortunately, many other swing states are not voting by mail despite of 52 COVID-19 cases caused by the in-person primary election in Wisconsin.  Let’s get Democrats sign up for absentee ballot.  Vote by Mail will make the difference this November.  This is our fight.

Join us to learn how to use VoteFwd to write to Democrats in swing states to sign up for absentee ballot so they can safely Vote by Mail.  The training will be conducted as a virtual meeting using zoom. **You must RSVP** to get your unique link to the zoom meeting.  

When we Vote, We Win.  When we write, We Vote.  When we Text, We Vote.  When we Call, We Vote.
