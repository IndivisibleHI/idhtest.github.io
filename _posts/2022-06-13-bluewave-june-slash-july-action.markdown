Are you watching the January 6th hearings? Are you worried that we still have so many voters supporting  Trump supported candidates (like Hershel Walker and Dr. Oz) in swing states?  Do you have an hour or two a week you can volunteer to keep U.S. Congress blue this mid-term election?  

You can text and write to register left leaning voters and get Dems out to vote in swing states. We provide you with training, texting tools, and names & mobile numbers.  You can text out 5000 initial messages in 2 hours, reply rate is 10-15%, and you will be using just your first name & computer.  We provide you with instructions, names & addresses, and postcards. We know that your hand-written, personal messages win elections.

We have been textbanking with PA Dems weekly, and writing Field Team 6 and Reclaim Our Votes postcards to Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin already. [Volunteer today](https://forms.gle/KRrF1P6fr2FkTXvF9) to keep U.S. Congress blue.
