Come join the Elections Team for a laid back evening where we work on some postcards encouraging Democrats to vote. And eat some pizza! Sound OK?? 
We'll have the postcards, stamps and pens. Just bring yourself, a clipboard if you have one, and a few dollars to help us cover food and supplies. Salads and beverages also welcome additions to the gathering.
More info on the specific elections we'll be focused on closer to the date!
