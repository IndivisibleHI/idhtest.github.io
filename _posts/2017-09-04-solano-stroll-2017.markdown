Spend an hour or two at the Solano Stroll in North Berkeley and stop by the Indivisible Berkeley booth at 1715 Solano Ave near Tulare Ave. Or even better: volunteer on our 3-5:30 tabling shift, which still needs 2 more volunteers for a fully-staffed table. You will be able to talk to other Berkeley residents about what you like about Indivisible Berkeley, and tell them how they can get involved!

RSVP to [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](info@indivisibleberkeley.org) if you'd like to help out from 3-5:30.
