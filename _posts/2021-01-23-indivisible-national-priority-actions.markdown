**Read on for your top actions to help put pressure on the new Congress and start holding their feet to the fire -Indivisible style.**

**Here are your top actions for the week ahead:**

1. **[Demand your representative commit to vote yes on H.R. 1, the For the People Act, which focuses on key democracy reforms, when it reaches the House floor.](https://act.indivisible.org/go/536783?t=6&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)** H.R. 1 is an important first step towards building an equitable democracy, along with the D.C. statehood bill and John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Without a functional democracy in which everyone is included and represented, we can’t achieve any of our other progressive goals. All the issues we care about deeply -- health care, immigration, ending wars, racial justice, climate change -- fixing these things requires a democracy that is responsive to the people, not the powerful and wealthy. That’s why it’s so critical that we push for this legislation as early as possible. Call your representatives today.

2. **[Demand your senators support the conviction and permanent disqualification of Donald Trump.](https://act.indivisible.org/go/534683?t=7&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)** One day after Biden’s inauguration, Trump’s GOP allies are already spinning up messaging to downplay the danger he poses to our democracy and deflect attempts to prevent him from running for federal office again. We can’t lose sight of the imminent danger that Trump continues to pose to our republic.

3. **[Read and share our explainer on H.R. 1](https://act.indivisible.org/go/213769?t=8&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)**, what’s included in it, and why it’s important to pass right now to help spread the word about the importance of this legislative work.

4. **[Demand your representative support the D.C. statehood bill](https://act.indivisible.org/go/521187?t=9&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)**. H.R. 1, alongside the D.C. Statehood bill and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, are the cornerstones of the necessary reforms we need to unrig our democracy and make it work for all. The District’s lone representative in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (who has no vote on the House floor), has already introduced her D.C. statehood bill in the 117th Congress with 202 original co-sponsors -- a record for the bill. If Democrats care about fixing our democracy and ensuring racial justice for all, then they must support statehood for D.C.

5. **[Review the new Indivisible Guide](https://act.indivisible.org/go/535058?t=10&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)**. We’ve got a short window to do everything in our power to fix our democracy, and we’ve got no time to waste. If you haven’t already, make sure to check out our newest Indivisible Guide, [A Practical Guide for Fixing Our Democracy](https://act.indivisible.org/go/535058?t=11&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o). In it you’ll find important learnings from the last time we had a Democratic trifecta, insider tips for engaging with your member of Congress, and more.
