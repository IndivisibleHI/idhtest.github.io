Crunch time -- get  voters to the polls!  We'll be calling for one of our targeted races for Congress -- MUST WINS if we want to put a check on the Republican agenda.  Republican donors are pouring money into these races.  We need all hands on deck, starting NOW,  to push these candidates over the finish line:

From 2-4pm in Central Berkeley, we'll be calling for Josh Harder for Congress -- a strong, progressive candidate in a very tight race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto). This is a frighteningly tight race -- please help us out!

From 5-8pm in Albany, we'll be calling for Jacky Rosen for Senate in Nevada!  Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. If we work hard! 

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

2 LOCATIONS!  Central Berkeley, near Sacramento St,  2-4pm  &  Albany, 5-8pm.

RSVP soon – space may be limited, and this helps us plan if more space is needed.

Then look for an email with subject ‘Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days so you’ll know where to go!
