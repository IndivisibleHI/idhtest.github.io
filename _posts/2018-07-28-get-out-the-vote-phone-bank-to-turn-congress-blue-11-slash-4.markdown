Crunch time -- get  voters to the polls!  We'll be calling for our targeted races for Congress -- MUST WINS if we want to put a check on the Republican agenda.  

From 2-4pm in Central Berkeley, we'll be calling for JACKY ROSEN FOR SENATE in NEVADA!  Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. If we work hard! 

From 5-8pm in Albany, we'll be calling for HARDER FOR CONGRESS -- a strong, progressive candidate in a very tight race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto). This is a frighteningly tight race -- please help us out!

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon – space may be limited, and this helps us plan if more space is needed.

Then look for an email with subject ‘Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days so you’ll know where to go!
