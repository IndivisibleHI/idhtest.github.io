We will be canvassing on Saturday  February 17th in CD10. It will be in Manteca or Modesto and the hours are still being negotiated. 

To sign up, email [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com) and [Jeff](mailto:carlockjeff@gmail.com). 

It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before.  Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people. If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, feel free to get in touch with [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com), [Jeff ](carlockjeff@gmail.com)or [us](mailto:elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.
