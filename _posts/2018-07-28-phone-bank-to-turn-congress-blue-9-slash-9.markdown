We’ll be calling for Jacky Rosen, the Democrat running to take back a Nevada Senate Seat. This is a "must win" if Dems have any hope of winning control of the Senate -- a long shot, but possible. Let's do our best to get a Senate that will check Trump's court nominations! All hands on deck!

WHAT YOU’ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we’ll get back to you with more details.
