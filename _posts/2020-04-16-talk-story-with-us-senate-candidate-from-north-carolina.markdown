We need 38 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.  Join SwingLeft Asheville, NC team's conversation with U.S. Senate Democratic candidate from North Carolina, Cal Cunningham.  The [latest poll](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/senate/nc/north_carolina_senate_tillis_vs_cunningham-6908.html) shows Cal toe-to-toe with the incumbent Thom Tills.  Tillis is the U.S. Senator who said he too would have welcomed Russia's help.  Cal is a former NC State Senator who volunteered after 9/11 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He currently serves as vice chair for Governor's Crime Commission.  Learn more about him at https://www.calfornc.com/.
