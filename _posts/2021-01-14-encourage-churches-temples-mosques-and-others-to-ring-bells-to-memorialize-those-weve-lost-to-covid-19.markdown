**Please reach out to your place of worship to encourage them to participate in this National, Non-Denominational, Bell Ringing Memorial to honor those we've lost to COVID-19.**

**Day:   Tuesday, Jan 19 (the day before the Inauguration)
Time: 12:30 HST**

**Details:**
From Pili Tobar, the Communications Director of the Presidential Inauguration Committee (PIC):

“The inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris represents the beginning of a new national journey.

However, in the midst of a pandemic — when so many Americans are grieving the loss of family, friends, and neighbors — it is important that we honor those who have died, reflect on what has been one of the more challenging periods in the nation’s history, and renew our commitment to coming together to end the pandemic and rebuild our nation.

PIC is inviting cities and towns around the country to join Washington, D.C., in [illuminating buildings and] ringing church bells in a national moment of unity and remembrance."
