  **You:** Hello! My name is [name] and I’m calling from Berkeley. I’m glad to hear that [Senator/Representative name] is speaking out against Trump's decision to end the DACA program. Will the [Senator/Representative] commit to me, a constituent, that they will demand that the DREAM Act be included in any must-pass bill that is scheduled for a vote this month?

  **Staffer:** [Yes, and ... / No, because ...]

  **You:** Will [Senator/Representative name] also commit to holding out for a clean DREAM Act - one that does not include additional funding for ICE or for a border wall?


  [If the staffer is non-committal, you can ask to receive an update and provide your phone number and/or email address. Please let us know how your call goes by emailing [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org) or contacting the [Immigration Team](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/team/immigration)]

Along with natural disasters in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the USVI, our country now faces the Trump-made tragedy of ending relief from deportation for 800,000 young Americans who now face an uncertain future. Tell Senators Feinstein and Harris and Representative Lee (our MoCs) to include a clean DREAM Act in any must-pass legislative vehicles this month. The DREAM Act would give DACA recipients and others who arrived in the United States as children a path to permanent lawful status and eventual citizenship. Call our MoCs today and demand that they include a clean “DREAM Act” in any must-pass bill.

It is critically important that Congress pass a "clean" DREAM Act - one that does not include any funding for a border wall or increased funding for ICE enforcement. Protecting Dreamers while placing their families at greater risk of deportation is not acceptable.
