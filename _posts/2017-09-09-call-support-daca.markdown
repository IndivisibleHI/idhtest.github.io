  [You]

  Hello! My name is [name] and I’m calling from Berkeley about DACA. Could you please tell me what the [Senator/Representative] plans to do to speak out against Trump’s announcement that he is ending the DACA program?

  [Staff member's response…]

  Sure. [Senator/Representative] gave a speech on the floor recently that talked about the importance of DACA for immigrants and for our state’s economy. And yesterday she did an epic tweet storm.

  [You]

  That’s great, but it’s going to take more than talk and tweet storms to keep 800,000 DACA recipients from falling into Trump’s deportation machine. Will the [Senator/Representative] commit to me, a constituent, that she will demand that the DREAM Act be included in any must-pass bill that is scheduled for a vote this month?

  [If the staffer is non-committal, you can ask to receive an update and provide your phone number and/or email address. Please let us know how your call goes by emailing [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org) or contacting the [Immigration Team](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/team/immigration)]

Now that the Trump White House announced the end of DACA, Congress has two disasters to immediately respond to—one of them is Harvey, and the other one is the Trump-made tragedy of ending relief from deportation for 800,000 young Americans who now face an uncertain future. Tell Senators Feinstein and Harris and Representative Lee (our MoCs) to include a clean DREAM Act in any must-pass legislative vehicles this month. The DREAM Act would give DACA recipients and others who arrived in the United States as children a path to permanent lawful status and eventual citizenship. Call our MoCs today and demand that they include a clean “DREAM Act” in any must-pass bill.
