Hawaii Gov. David Ige used his emergency powers in March to declare a statewide lockdown of Hawaii’s economy and social fabric, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

He also suspended the state’s generally excellent open-meetings and open-records laws, leaving Hawaii citizens in the dark about the proceedings of their government.

Was it really necessary to suspend the state’s Sunshine Law concerning open meetings and Uniform Information Practices Act concerning open-records to help fight the coronavirus? What can be done to restore government transparency and accountability in Hawaii?

Sandy Ma, executive director of Common Cause Hawaii, and Brian Black, executive director of the Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest, will help answer these questions during a free live webinar starting at noon on Tuesday, April 21, at an internet connection near you.

Common Cause Hawaii is dedicated to strengthening public participation in government; curbing the influence of money in politics; ensuring that government serves the common good, rather than special interests; and promoting fair, honest and modern elections.”

The Civil Beat Law Center is committed to promoting transparency and responsiveness in government, believing that secrecy fuels distrust of public officials.

Moderator for the webinar will be Keli‘i Akina, Ph.D., president and CEO of the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, which is dedicated to promoting individual liberty, economic freedom and accountable government.
