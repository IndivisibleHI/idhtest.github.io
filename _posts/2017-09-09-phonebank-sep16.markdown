TWW Albany-Berkeley and The Sister District Project of CA-13 are working to support the campaigns of Cheryl Turpin and Kathy Tran in November 2017 Virginia house of delegates elections. Cheryl and Kathy are both amazing candidates---Cheryl is a high school teacher passionate about environmental issues, and Kathy came to this country as a refugee when she was just seven months old. Both of these candidates are fighting hard for our shared values, and they are so excited to have the support of volunteers like you.

We have set up phone banking parties every weekend until Election Day! Studies show at least one extra vote for every 35 calls with voters! And, we know each vote counts in our efforts to flip the VA House of Delegates blue! Please see a list of the phone banking parties below. To RSVP to any of the phone banks, fill out the requested information at the RSVP link and check off all the dates you would like to attend. The host will email you the full address plus other details in advance of the party. Space may be limited, but if one party fills up, we will be happy to help find you another to attend. For questions, please email Patricia (pvjones10 at gmail dot com) or Rachel (sdp.ca.13.phonebank@gmail.com).

Please bring:
- a charged cell phone
- a charged laptop or tablet
- a pair of headphones/earbuds
- charging cords just in case
