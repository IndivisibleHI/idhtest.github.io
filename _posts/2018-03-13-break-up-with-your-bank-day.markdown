**May 1 is Break Up with Your Bank Day!**

The Economic Justice Team, working with Fossil Free California and others, is working to help Berkeley residents to follow the lead of the City of Berkeley and leave Wells Fargo and the other mega banks that financially support fossil fuels, dangerous pipelines, private prisons, the NRA and gun manufacturers ... heck there are so many reasons to break up with your bank. We'll have advice on how to do it with the least disruption, and how to find another bank or a credit union that best fits your needs. Stay tuned for more updates!
