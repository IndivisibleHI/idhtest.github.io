Join Cal grads and undergrads at our voter contact party on campus! There will be food. Co-sponsored by the Cal Progressive Student Association (PSA).

Indivisible Berkeley uses research-based methods to increase voter turnout and vote out Jeff Denham, a Republican in Congress who rubber-stamps Trump's agenda.

- Call voters, remind them about the election, and get their commitment to vote for Josh Harder, the Democrat running against Denham.
- Text voters to get their attention.
- Write postcards to voters so they'll get an individualized letter in the mail reminding them to vote Democrat!

Location TBD but likely Wheeler Hall
