Josh Harder for Congress! Help us phone for this strong, progressive candidate in a frighteningly tight and hard-fought race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto). 

WHAT YOU'LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon – space may be limited, and this helps us plan if more space is needed.

Then look for an email with subject ‘Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days so you’ll know where to go!
