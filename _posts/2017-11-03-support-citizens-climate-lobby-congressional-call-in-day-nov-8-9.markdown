### Action
The Science and Environment Team is supporting the Citizens Climate Lobby (CCL) Congressional Call-in Day.  CCL sends hundreds of citizens to Washington, DC, twice a year to educate and lobby MoCs (Members of Congress) to support the CCL carbon fee and dividend proposal (see “Background,” below).  Their upcoming Congressional Education Day is Nov. 14.  If you support CCL’s proposal, you can support their citizen lobbyists by calling or writing and referring to CCL’s proposal.  If you support climate action and carbon pricing but aren’t sure about CCL’s specific proposal, it is still a timely opportunity to let MoC’s know that you care about climate change and that pricing carbon is a powerful way to do it.  The CCL Congressional Call-in Day is designed to help MoCs be more ready to listen when their CCL constituents meet with them to educate and ask for climate action the following week.  

### Background
CCL has chapters throughout the country where they educate MoCs (Members of Congress) and the public about climate change and lobby for the CCL carbon fee and dividend proposal.  Their approach is designed to be both successful in mitigating climate change as well as successful in becoming law by appealing to both progressives and conservatives.  Their proposal calls for placing a steadily increasing fee on carbon and returning the proceeds in a dividend to all households.  More on CCL’s carbon fee and dividend proposal can be found [here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/basics-carbon-fee-dividend/).  Many experts believe that putting a price on carbon is one of the most effective ways to address climate change.  It is an approach that some powerful conservatives are also beginning to accept.
