  Hello! My name is (name) and I'm a constituent from Berkeley. I'm calling to tell Senator, No Jones No Vote. The Senate must respect the will of the people of Alabama and wait until Doug Jones is seated before any votes on legislation or appointments can take place.

  [Response: that's a bit drastic, no?]

  The people of Alabama have spoken. The Senate must not subvert democracy. Will the Senator commit to holding up all votes until Senator-elect Doug Jones is seated?

  [Response: I'll pass this on]

  Please do, and please take down my contact information so you can send me the Senator's response. Thank you for your time.

The Senate must not take any new actions until the will of the people of Alabama is respected with the swearing in of Senator-elect Jones, DEMOCRAT OF ALABAMA (!)
