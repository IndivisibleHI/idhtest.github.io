As many of you know, this year the Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted to reconstitute the Sheriff Ahern-created Urban Shield training.
The taskforce charged with implementing the transition from the "last Urban Shield as we know it" to a different kind of emergency preparedness training, will be meeting in Berkeley in the City Council chambers (2134 MLK Way, Berkeley 94707) on Monday, November 19th, at 9am.
This meeting is open to the public. We encourage all interested Alameda County residents to attend and urge the taskforce to advance a non-militarized vision for emergency training.
