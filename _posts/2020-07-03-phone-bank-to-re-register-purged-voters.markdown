We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.  

Eligible voters of color are being purged from voter rolls at a much higher rate than white voters.  Join Reclaim Our Vote to call 400,000 voters of color to re-register them, sign them up for absentee ballot, and to give them accurate information about voting every Tuesdays between July 7th and November 3rd.

Training starts at 10:30AM HST 4:40PM EDT.  Phonebanking starts at 11AM HST and 5PM EDT.  **You must RSVP** to get zoom meeting information. 

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
