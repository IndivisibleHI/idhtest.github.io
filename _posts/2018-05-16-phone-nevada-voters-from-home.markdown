HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT!  Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate. Think.Supreme.Court. This is a tight race -- we really need your help!

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a computer, ipad or tableT, and your phone (landline or cell).
