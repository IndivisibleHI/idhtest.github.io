HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT!  We're working with Nevada Democrats starting NOW to build the foundations of a strong  Democratic campaign for Senate in Nevada .  The Nevada seat is a MUST WIN if Democrats are to have any chance of taking back the Senate -- and potentially keeping Trump from filling another seat on the Supreme Court!

Right now we're helping the Democrats build a strong ground game by identifying likely Democratic voters to drive to the polls in November -- and finding volunteers.  There is a lot of interest and energy in the state to take back Republican Senator Heller's seat, so we're likely to find potential volunteers that can help on the coordinated campaign there.

To call from home, you just need a computer, laptop or tablet with an internet connection (where the script and contacts will show), and a phone.  The phone bank is open 12-9pm daily.
