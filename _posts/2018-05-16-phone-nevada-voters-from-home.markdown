HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT!  Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate. Think.Supreme.Court. This is a tight race -- we really need your help!

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a computer, ipad or tablet, and your phone (landline or cell).

To get involved, please RSVP using the link at left and also email us at phonebank+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org, and we’ll get back to you with more details. 
Then look for an email with subject "Indivisible Berkeley” in the next few days!
