Earlier this month, a subcommittee of the Berkeley City Council voted to recommend sitting out the Urban Shield SWAT competition and vendor show in 2018, while supporting fire, EMT and emergency manager participation and evaluating Berkeley’s role in the reconstituted exercise next year. 

The recommendation will come before the City Council at its July 24, 2018 meeting.

This is a victory for those of us who oppose Berkeley’s continued participation in Urban Shield’s 2018 SWAT Team war games. It follows closely on the heels of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors’ decision to end Urban Shield as it is currently constituted as of 2019 due to community concerns over how the SWAT competition promotes racism, xenophobia and the militarization of local police forces.  

Already the Berkeley Police Department is mobilizing to defeat this recommendation, playing on Trumpian fears of terrorism and crime. We need to mobilize the community to support Mayor Arreguin and Council Members Cheryl Davila and Kate Harrison in their principled vote to end Berkeley’s participation in the 2018 Urban Shield SWAT competition and vendor show. 

Here is what Berkeley residents can do to make sure the Berkeley City Council passes this motion:

1) Show up at the last Urban Shield subcommittee meeting this Monday, June 18th, at 2:30 pm, at Berkeley City Council Chambers,   2134 Martin Luther King Jr. Way.   There will be efforts made to undermine this recommendation, and we must show that the community is in support.  

2) Email your support for the motion to the Berkeley City Council at council@cityofberkeley.info. Here is a sample email:

"Dear City Council Members,

I support the Urban Shield Subcommittee motion on Berkeley’s participation in 2018 Urban Shield. After a year of research and discussion in public meetings, this motion correctly addresses the concerns of all Berkeley residents. It continues Berkeley Fire Department, emergency response staff and volunteer participation in training at Urban Shield 2018 focused on response to those mass disasters most likely to affect Berkeley: wildfires, earthquakes, hazardous material releases and the need to shelter in place. It suspends Berkeley’s participation in the 2018 SWAT scenarios and vendor show, which promote racism, xenophobia and the militarization of our police force. It allows for reevaluation of Berkeley’s participation in 2019, by which time the Alameda County Board of Supervisors will have developed a reconstituted emergency prevention and response training. I urge you to vote to support this recommendation when it comes before the Council."

3) Mark Tuesday, July 24th on your calendar NOW  to be sure to attend the City Council meeting where the subcommittee’s motion will be voted upon.

4)  Share this information with all your friends and neighbors and encourage them to email and show up at the Tuesday, July 24th City Council Meeting.
