  Caller: Hello! My name is [___] and I’m calling from Berkeley. I’m calling to let [Senator __] know that I strongly oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This tax bill is a scam that will give massive cuts to the wealthy, paid for by stripping 1.8 MILLION people in California of their health care and raising taxes on almost 4 MILLION middle-class Californians.

  Staffer: Thank you for calling! The Senator is against the Republican tax bill; she does not believe we should give a tax cut to the wealthy and corporations or strip people of their health insurance coverage.

  Caller: That’s great. I’m very glad the Senator is standing with her constituents instead of standing with Donald Trump and his rich friends. Will the Senator commit to withholding consent on votes in the Senate so that we have time to mobilize against this bill?

  Staffer: I haven’t talked to the Senator about that, but I’ll pass your thoughts along.

  Caller: That’s what I expect out of the Senator. It’s not enough just to vote no, she needs to actively work to slow down the Trump Tax Scam and expose it for the scam it is. Democrats started withholding consent during the health care fight—and it worked. That’s what I want to see again here. Please take down my info so you can let me know what she is doing to slow down the Trump Tax Scam.

  Staffer: I’ll pass your thoughts along to the Senator.

  Caller: Yes please do, and please take down my contact information so you can let me know what the Senator decides to do.

This plan isn’t "tax reform." It’s tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of our communities.

1,810,000 people in California would lose health insurance coverage

3,969,800 California families would see a tax increase

Republican leaders in the Senate released a new Senate version of the Trump Tax Scam that includes a repeal of the individual mandate. Repealing the individual mandate, which requires that every American have health insurance or pay a penalty, was the centerpiece of the Republicans' failed effort to pass the "skinny repeal" bill in the Senate in July. Numerous major health care groups have come out strongly against the idea of repealing the individual mandate, saying that it will lead to "a significant increase in premiums, which would in turn substantially increase the number of uninsured Americans." And that's on top of the massive, permanent corporate tax cut the Republicans want to pay for by putting an expiration date on the parts Republicans say will help the middle class.


That means that, more than ever, the tax fight = the health care fight and the health care fight = the tax fight. We know the game plan from the last time we beat them on health care. We need massive constituent pressure on Democrats to get them to do everything they can to slow down the Trump Tax Scam.
