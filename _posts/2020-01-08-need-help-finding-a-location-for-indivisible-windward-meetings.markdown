We are currently scheduled to have our Windward Blue Wave Voter Registration letter writing sessions in the Down to Earth cafe. They don't require you to be a paying customer and provide a large community room that meets our requirements. 

However, we were recently asked to look for an alternative site since Down To Earth is owned by Chris Butler's group - the Tulsi Gabbard cult -- which has been virulently anti-gay . 

**We're looking for alternative, free, community spaces that are not constrained by IRS 501c3 tax exempt status** barring them from permitting partisan political activities . We've reached out to schools and colleges, churches and other organizations such as Alexander & Baldwin (not taking new users) and other sites that were too small (Morning Brew and Libby Tomar's office). 

Lack of space has inhibited us from meeting for a couple of years but it is now 2020 and we need to take back the Senate, grow the House majority and get the menace out of the White House! \
