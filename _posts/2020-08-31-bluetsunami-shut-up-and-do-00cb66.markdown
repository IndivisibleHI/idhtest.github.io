November 1, 2020 
1381 days since Trump took office, [pick your worst nightmare of the Trump Administration]. Now imagine 1460 more days of the Trump Administration.

2 days to go until the election day of our life time. READY to dedicate two hours of your time per week to **Dump Trump** and **flip the U.S. Senate** blue? Using “Shut Up and Write” structure which writers effectively used for years, we will zoom and then write/call/text to the voters in swing states.

11:30AM to NOON HST: Optional Training (phonebanking, textbanking, VoteFwd letter writing)
NOON to 1:30PM HST: Shut Up and Do

You must **RSVP/register** to receive your unique link to join “BlueWave Hawaii Shut Up and Do” zoom meeting.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
