Most of us believe that for democracy to work for all of us, it must include us all. After voters turned out in record numbers in the November election, some politicians are using election lies as pretext for imposing additional barriers to voting. Compared to last year at this time, state legislators have introduced four times as many bills to restrict people’s basic right to vote.

Join our messaging briefing on winning the narrative against attacks on voting, cohosted by Voting Rights Lab and the Leadership Conference. We will share new data about where the public stands for proactive voting policies and the latest messaging and tactics to counter the attacks on voting that we’re seeing in states across the country.

* **WHAT:** Winning the Narrative on Voting Rights

* **WHEN:** Wednesday, February 24th 9:30am HST

* **WHO:** Tyler Lewis (Leadership Conference), Jiggy Athilingam (Voting Rights Lab), Anat Shenker-Osorio (ASO Communications)

**RSVP:** https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_YhTT_wtjT5mx6PBkx9rYNQ

Look forward to seeing you there!
