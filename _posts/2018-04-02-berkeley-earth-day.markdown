[Berkeley Earth Day](https://browercenter.org/exhibitions-programs/programs/) is presented by: Compassionate Living, Citizens Climate Lobby, David Brower Center, Downtown Berkeley Association, Ecology Center, & Our Children's Trust. This event features dozens of vendors sharing their delicious sustainable foods, eco-friendly products, and epic activism. Berkeley Earth Day is excited to feature the [Wild & Scenic Film Fest](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wild-and-scenic-film-festival-tickets-43322093548). These films transform viewers to become committed activists, dedicated to saving our increasingly threatened planet and include an optional series of short films for children. (Please note that Berkeley Earth Day is a free event, but the Wild & Scenic film screenings require purchased tickets.) To participate in more actions like this, join the [Science & Environment Team](Science & Environment Team).
