The Hawaii Democratic Party will no longer conduct caucuses to determine our Presidential nominee.

Instead, you must officially join the Democratic party. You will then be mailed a  Hawaii Democratic Presidential Preference ballot prior to the April 4 Hawaii Democratic Presidential Primary.

Good news – no more long lines and torn pieces of paper for ballots. Bad news – you likely aren’t enrolled with the Democratic party.

More details:

The state of Hawaii does not register voters for any political party.  The state voter registration form does not include a party preference and no Hawaii voters are "registered Democrats" with the state.

Hawaii has a Party-Run Presidential Primary, not paid for or organized by the state.  The Hawaii Democratic Party will mail Presidential preference ballots to everyone who enrolls with the Party.  The winner of the Hawaii primary - our "Presidential Preference Poll"--will get all 33 Hawaii delegates to the Democratic National Convention.  This could affect the outcome of the Convention and the Democratic nominee for President.  If you want to help choose who runs against Trump in November, you must ENROLL with the Democratic Party.

The Hawaii Democrats have revised our primary system.  Details are available at [https://hawaiidemocrats.org/2020ppp/](https://hawaiidemocrats.org/2020ppp/)

The most important takeaways:

* Mail-in ballots will be provided to every Democrat enrolled with the Democratic Party of Hawai'i.

* Voting will be conducted with ranked choice ballots, allowing voters to list their preferred candidates from 1 - 5.

* In-person voting & same day registration options will be provided on Sat, April 4 (only one location on each major island).

* When we register new voters, we can also inform and assist them in enrolling in the Democratic Party.
