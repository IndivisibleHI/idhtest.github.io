Indivisible Hawaii is going to hold a second census related event at Impact Hub 1-4pm September 23.   A workshop with the lead data specialist for the Census Bureau western region will be here to provide data workshops for nonprofit organizations.  This event is being coordinated between Indivisible Hawaii, the Hawaii State office of Research & Economic Analysis, and the US Census bureau.  

This workshop will consist of:
- a briefing on the how the census is developing in Hawaii
