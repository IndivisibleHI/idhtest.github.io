Organized by the ACLU of Northern California:

Clean Dream Act Phonebank
ACLU of Northern California San Francisco Office
39 Drumm St, San Francisco, CA 94111
(One block from Embarcadero BART)

Date and time:
Thursday, October 26, 5:30 PM

Join the ACLU-NC as we begin a phone banking campaign to garner support for a clean DREAM Act, legislation that provides a legal pathway for undocumented immigrant youth that does not include a border wall, more ICE and CBP officers, or increased border security.

Bring your cell phone and charger, headphones (for comfort), and a laptop or tablet (we can provide a few for folks who don't have one). Be prepared to meet others in the movement to protect immigrant families. We will provide a script and training.

Vegetarian dinner will be provided but please reach out if you have further dietary restrictions.
