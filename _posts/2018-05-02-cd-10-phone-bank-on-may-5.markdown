Help us flip a congressional district and check Trump's agenda!
If you’ve never phone banked before, this is an easy first shot at it. These phone banks are focused on recruiting new volunteers to come canvass with Indivisible Berkeley in CD-10. You’ll be calling fellow IB-ers and you’ll have Elections Team members on hand to help you out with any questions you might have.

FLASH!  Coming soon -- and possibly this date -- as soon as we get the word from our friends in Congressional District 10, we’ll be calling constituents there to start generating mid-term excitement!

**What you’ll need:** an ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone, with earbuds.
