HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT!  We're working with Nevada Democrats starting NOW to build the foundations of a strong  Democratic campaign for Senate in their state.  The Nevada seat is a MUST WIN if Democrats are to have any chance of taking back the Senate -- and potentially keeping Trump from filling another seat on the Supreme Court!

Right now we're helping the Democrats build a strong ground game by finding volunteers and identifying likely Democratic voters to drive to the polls in November.  There is a lot of interest and energy in the state to take back Republican Senator Heller's seat, so we're likely to find potential volunteers who just need to be put in touch with the Senate campaign.

To call from home, you just need a phone and a computer, laptop or tablet with an internet connection (where the script and contacts will show).  

RSVP  below, and we'll get back to you with the details!
