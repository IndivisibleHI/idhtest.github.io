Along with the many other reasons for opposing his nomination to the Supreme Court is Kavanaugh’s record on climate and the environment.  His nomination has the potential to lock the Supreme Court into a conservative majority on these issues for decades.  California’s senators are already on record opposing the nomination, but this is the fight of a generation, and **we need your help to do the following:**

**Action:** Ask your friends, family and social media contacts in the following states to call their senators to oppose Kavanaugh’s nomination.  (Please DO NOT CALL SENATORS FROM OTHER STATES, yourself; it is counter-productive, as explained [here](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/not-call-members-arent/?link_id=1&can_id=06c9460b9153c981a6209546f87ff5a0&source=email-newsletter-717-call-only-your-members-of-congress&email_referrer=email_386130___subject_480498&email_subject=newsletter-717-call-only-your-members-of-congress).)  Callers can click on a senator’s name, below, to display a page with phone numbers.

- Alaska - Republican [Lisa Murkowski](https://www.murkowski.senate.gov/contact/office-locations)  
- Indiana - Democrat [Joe Donnelly](https://www.donnelly.senate.gov/contact/office-locations) (his state voted for Trump)
- Maine - Republican [Susan Collins](https://www.numbersusa.com/content/my/congress/395/contact)
- North Dakota - Democrat [Heidi Heitkamp](https://www.numbersusa.com/content/my/congress/11588/contact) (her state voted for Trump)

**Background** 
*This background focuses on climate and the environment because it was prepared by our Science & Environment Team.  Information on additional reasons to oppose Kavanaugh is linked at the end*. 

Kavanaugh is much further right than Justice Kennedy.  He narrowly interprets the laws that authorize EPA (and other agencies) to establish protections, and he most often rules to limit government agencies’ authorities to protect the public.  In more than a dozen cases, he has expressed skepticism of safeguards and consistently ruled against EPA’s actions to limit pollution and address climate change.  

Before the next presidential election, the Supreme Court could rule on the EPA’s authority to fight climate change, the scope of the Clean Water Act, and the constitutionality of the Endangered Species Act. Kavanaugh has already expressed skepticism about whether EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The Court could overturn the endangerment finding that has allowed EPA to set standards to limit  those emissions.

In prior decisions or dissents he has weighed costs of protections over the health benefits, even when the authorizing law does not require it. 

Since a 1984 Supreme Court decision, the Court has granted agencies like EPA “deference” to use their expertise to establish protections under certain conditions, including demonstrating the reasonableness of those protections.  Judge Kavanaugh would join Gorsuch and the other conservative judges to eliminate this deference to agency science experts.  A change in deference would have far-reaching effects on protections, putting the Court in charge of interpreting law in areas outside their expertise and tying up agency action with almost routine court cases to review those actions.    

Kavanaugh won’t protect the environment, and he won’t protect the following (for more info click [here](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/must-stop-kavanaugh-becoming-trumps-next-supreme-court-justice/)):  

- Our democracy, by holding Trump accountable for threats posed to our electoral system
- Consumers, by reigning in corporate and privacy abuse  
- A woman’s right to choose 
- Affordable health care
- LGBTQ equality
