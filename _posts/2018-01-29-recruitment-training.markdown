Learn how to expand our Indivisible Berkeley community by recruiting your friends and family! In this training, you'll learn how to have an effective recruitment conversation and get a chance to practice with a friendly partner before taking your newfound skills to the outside world.

We'll cover

- why does it matter?
- "I'm not really into politics"
- "I'm just one person. I can't make a difference"
