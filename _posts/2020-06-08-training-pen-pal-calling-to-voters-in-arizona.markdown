We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.

We are teaming up with The Arizona Ground Game for a "pen pal" program to get left-leaning newly registered voters sign up for absentee ballot and to turnout the votes for Democratic candidates.  This "pen pal" program has four voter contacts, starts in May and ends in November.  If you already signed up for the program, sign up for this second of four trainings. The Arizona Ground Game team will train us on second voter contact - follow up phone calls.  If you haven't signed up but can help out with the follow up phone calls, please join us for this training.  

Please RSVP to get your unique link to the zoom meeting.  Email natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you have any questions.
