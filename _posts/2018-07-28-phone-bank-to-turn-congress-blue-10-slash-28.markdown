Crunch time!  Call voters  and drive them to the polls to vote for Josh Harder for Congress!  Josh is a strong, progressive candidate in a frighteningly tight race in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto). Let's send him to Washington!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
