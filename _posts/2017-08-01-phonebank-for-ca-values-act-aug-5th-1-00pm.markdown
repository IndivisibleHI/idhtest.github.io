**GET STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT OF THE DEPORTATION BUSINESS.**

We'll be calling registered Democrats in Northern California target districts to ask them to call their own Assemblymember and the Governor to ask them to support the California Values Act (SB 54).  

This is a critical time because there’s organized opposition who misunderstand the bill and wrongly say it protects criminals.  **In fact, the bill is pro-public safety** by not only (1.) allowing victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported, but the bill will also (2.) "ensure that criminals serve their time, providing justice to victims, rather than being deported before they are punished."  - Pro tem leader Kevin de León, author of the bill

_Strong Grassroots support will be needed until the Governor signs this bill into law._

**Your work will make an important difference.**

Bring a cell phone with earbuds for comfort (no laptop needed!).
