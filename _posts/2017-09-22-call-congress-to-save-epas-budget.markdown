  ## Suggested Script for Senators (personalize if possible):

  Hi, my name is \[NAME\] and I’m a constituent from \[CITY, ZIP\].

  EPA’s work to protect the public and our environment is important to me.   I’m counting on the Senate to keep EPA strong.  The Agency’s budget and staffing have been flat or declining for years and were hit hard by sequestration.   EPA’s budget should be increased to compensate for those cuts and to meet its mission, which is broader and more important than ever.  Please fortify its science and technology budget, ensure that climate science and climate programs are strong, increase staffing to match EPA’s broad responsibilities, and save the important programs slated for elimination.   Please ensure that a clean budget is passed with no policy riders.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

  ## Suggested Script for Representatives (personalize if possible):

  Hi, my name is \[NAME\] and I’m a constituent from \[CITY, ZIP\].

  EPA’s work to protect the public and our environment is important to me.  House budget proposals to date would result in the smallest EPA budget since the early Reagan administration when adjusted for inflation.  The Agency’s budget and staffing have been flat or declining for years and were hit hard by sequestration.  EPA’s budget should be increased to compensate for those cuts and to meet its mission, which is broader and more important than ever.  As the budget process goes forward, I urge you to improve House proposals.  Please fortify its science and technology budget, ensure that climate science and climate programs are strong, increase staffing to match the Agency’s broad responsibilities, and save the important programs slated for elimination.   Please ensure that a clean budget is passed with no policy riders.

  Thank you for your time and attention.
