Join 5-10 of your neighbors at one of our neighborhood dinners, hosted by and for IB members on Sunday, May 6. **We're still looking for hosts for Sunday brunch or dinner! Interested? [Email us!](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org)**

### RSVPs open on Thursday, April 26

At the meal, you'll have a chance to plan out how you'd like to contribute to the progressive wave for the 2018 midterm elections on November 6, 2018. Plus, no IB party would be complete without some postcards to get out the vote for a progressive candidate in a special election! (TBD)

We have hosts in the following zip codes:

- 94708 (brunch)
- 94709 (dinner)
