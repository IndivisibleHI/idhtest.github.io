We're calling voters, supporting Josh Harder for Congress -- a strong, progressive candidate in a very tight race against the incumbent in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto).

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

WHERE:  Oakland (Montclair)

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
