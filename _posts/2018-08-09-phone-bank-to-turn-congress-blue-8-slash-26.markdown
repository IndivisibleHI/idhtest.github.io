**We'll be calling voters to help send  Democrat Josh Harder  to Washington and turn Congress Blue!**  This is a tight race -- Republicans are pouring money into the district to shore up the incumbent.   But we can win this  -- if we all work together to make it happen.

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

**DATE:** Sunday, Aug 26, 1-4pm

**Location:** Montclair

**Please RSVP**, and we'll get back to you with more details --  Thank you!
