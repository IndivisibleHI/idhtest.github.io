**Two phone banks today, calling voters in CD-10 and in Nevada!  Both are "must wins" **if we want to put a check on the Republican agenda.  Republican donors are pouring money into these races.  We need all hands on deck, starting NOW,  to push these candidates over the finish line:

Josh Harder for Congress,  Josh is a strong, progressive candidate in a very tight race against the incumbent in neighboring CD-10 (Tracy, Modesto).

Jacky Rosen for the Nevada Senate seat. Remember, the Senate confirms Supreme Court nominees. We'll be supporting the Nevada State Democratic Party's coordinated campaign for Jacky as well strong candidates for the House and state offices.

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you. 

2 locations:   Oakland (Montclair), calling CD-10   &  West Berkeley, calling Nevada

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
