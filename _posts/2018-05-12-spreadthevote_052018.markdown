As of 2016, over 30 states require some form of identification at the polls - a new kind of poll tax.

These laws are designed to suppress voter turnout for the young, the elderly, and minorities â€“ the very groups that are in dire need of more representation in our government. The fight to end this poll tax is back. 

Come learn about how one grassroots organization -- Spread the Vote -- has taken on this fight in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Virginia and Tennessee by tackling the four biggest challenges faced by the targeted groups: money, time, transportation, and bureaucracy.

Hosted by the Voting Rights subteam of Indivisible Berkeley Elections Team.
