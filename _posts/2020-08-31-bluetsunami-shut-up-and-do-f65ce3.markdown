October 11, 2020
1360 days since Trump took office, [pick your worst nightmare of the Trump Administration].  Now imagine 1460 more days of the Trump Administration. 

23 days to go until the election day of our life time.  READY to dedicate two hours of your time per week to **Beat Trump** and **flip the U.S. Senate** blue? Using "Shut Up and Write" structure which writers effectively used for years, we will zoom and then write/call/text to the voters in swing states. 

* 11:30AM to NOON HST: Optional Training
* NOON to 1:30PM HST: Shut Up and Do

You must **RSVP/register** to receive your unique link to join "BlueWave Hawaii Shut Up and Do" zoom meeting Sunday October 11th NOON HST (or 11:30AM HST for optional training)

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
