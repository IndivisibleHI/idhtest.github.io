Join us on May 13 for the next Indivisible Berkeley General Assembly featuring the IB Elections Team. We're **six months out from the midterms** and it's time to make moves to take back Congress!

The Elections Team will have **specific actions and ways to contribute**. So come on down and bring a friend!

Doors open at 7. We start promptly at 7:30.

Our pre-GA training will take place at 6:30. Topic TBA.
