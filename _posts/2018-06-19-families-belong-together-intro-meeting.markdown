Join us as we discuss the situation regarding immigrant families at the border being split up.

We will report back from a coalition meeting with community partners, discuss ways we can get involved, and give opportunities for people to contribute their time and energy to the cause.

**Location to be determined. RSVP to receive information when we determine the location.**
