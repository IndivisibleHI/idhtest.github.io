Join the community circle to resist mass incarceration and immigrant internment at Richmond's West County Detention Center (WCDF)! Those detained right in our midst are our loved ones, neighbors, co-workers, and classmates. The impact of these racist, cruel separations has enormous economic and social impact on our communities. And the same is true for the general population in jail, who are also unfairly criminalized and detained for lengthy periods before trial.

Join community leaders for a one-hour vigil and protest to let those detained know that we are still fighting for them.

The site is accessible by car or by the #71 AC Transit bus.
