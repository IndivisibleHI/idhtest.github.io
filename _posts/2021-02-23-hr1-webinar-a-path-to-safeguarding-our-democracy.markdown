**The House will vote on HR1 next week!**\
Learn more about this bill and how we can help get it passed. 

**Topic**\
This will be a virtual conversation on voting rights with **Stacey Abrams & U.S. Senators Mazie Hirono, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker.** This discussion is on the fight for voting rights as depicted in “All In: the Fight for Democracy”, why we must pass the For the People Act (HR1), and the urgent need to act to safeguard our democracy.\
\
**Background**\
The 2020 election underscored the need for comprehensive, structural democracy reform. Americans across the country were forced to overcome rampant voter suppression, gerrymandering and a torrent of special-interest dark money just to exercise their vote and their voice in our democracy.

It shouldn’t have to be this way. American democracy urgently needs repair. We now have a historic opportunity to bring about transformative change.

That’s why House Democrats are committed to advancing HR1, the For the People Act – a transformational anti-corruption and clean elections reform package – in the 117th Congress. This bill is the centerpiece of Democrats’ agenda to make government more transparent and accountable to the people it serves.\
\
It will clean up corruption in Washington, empower the American people and restore faith and integrity to our government. \
