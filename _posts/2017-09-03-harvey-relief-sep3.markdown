  Hello, my name is [name] and I'm a constituent from [zip code] in Berkeley. I'm calling to urge the [Senator/Representative] to prioritize the Congressional response to aid Houston and other areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. In particular, here are 4 legislative actions the [Senator/Representative] can support.

  1. Quickly pass disaster relief for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.

  2. Fully fund FEMA, the Coast Guard, and infrastructure preparedness grants.

  3. Reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program before it expires on September 30.

  4. Continue speaking out about the present-day impact climate change has on our nation.

Hurricane Harvey is a national crisis. Dozens have lost their lives and there are thousands more who have been displaced, whose homes are underwater, whose lives have been shattered by Harvey. Our thoughts are with the people of Houston and the other affected communities in Texas and Louisiana.

Call up Senators Feinstein and Harris and Representative Lee to urge them to expedite funds for relief and recovery in Houston and other areas affected by Hurricane Harvey.
