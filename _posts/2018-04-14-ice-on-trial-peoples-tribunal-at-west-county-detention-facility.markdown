On Saturday, May 5, 2018, immigrant rights activists, community leaders and people who have been directly affected by the immigrant detention system will gather in front of the West County Detention Facility (WCDF) for a people’s tribunal to hold ICE and the Contra Costa Sheriff's Office accountable for their culture of secrecy and systemic abuse.

The tribunal is one of a series of coordinated people’s tribunals across the country as a part of the #ICEonTrial campaign. The campaign comes with a rise of retaliation by ICE against activists, as the agency is emboldened to be less transparent and unaccountable and to act with increased impunity under the Trump administration. 

Justice comes from the people!
La justicia viene del pueblo!

When: Saturday, May 5, 2018, 11:00 am - 1:00 pm
Where: Outside of West County Detention Facility, 5555 Giant Highway, Richmond, CA 94806
Organizers: Freedom for Immigrants (formerly known as CIVIC); Detention Watch Network; Pueblo Sin Fronteras; Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity; Let Our People Go; Contra Costa Immigrant Rights Alliance (CCIRA); Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI)
