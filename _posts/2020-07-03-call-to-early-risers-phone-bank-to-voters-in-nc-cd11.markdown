We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.  

Congressional District 11 in North Carolina is one of the "3fer"s - 1.  Biden 2. Cal Cunningham for U.S. Senate and 3. Moe Davis for U.S. House. U.S. House seat became vacant when Mark Meadows (yeah that one) became Trump's new Chief of Staff.  

Join Indivisible Asheville, NC team to motivate left-leaning voters in NC to get ready to vote and vote safely.  You will be using ThruTalk app. **
You must RSVP** to get zoom meeting information.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
