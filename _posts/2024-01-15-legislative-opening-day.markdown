The 2024 Regular Session is just around the corner. It opens on Wednesday, January 17, at 10:00 a.m. **Meet fellow Indivisible Hawai’i members at 1pm at the capitol, by the Father Damien statue**, to take a few photos and videos for our new website. Wear a turquoise Indivisible Hawai’i t-shirt if you have one.
