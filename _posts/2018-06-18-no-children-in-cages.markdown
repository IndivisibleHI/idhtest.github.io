Family separation is another Trump-created crisis. This is not at all required under current law — despite the lies coming out of Trump’s mouth — and Trump could put an end to this with a phone call. And like so many other Trump-created crises, Republicans in Congress are letting it happen. Some may have expressed concerns about the policy, but none have done anything about it. That’s where you come in.
