Trump won North Carolina in 2016 by only 3.8% and Biden is currently leading by 1.3%.  Yeah we can win in this southern state this November!

The court ordered NC CD-11 to be redrawn (to undo the gerrymandering) which means we have a chance to win this district for Moe Davis (Democratic candidate for U.S. House), Cal Cunningham (Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate) in addition to Biden/Harris ticket.  It's a tight race for NC governor and state legislators as well.  

Join SwingLeft/Indivisible Western NC team to call to turnout voters for the Dems.  Don’t worry if you’ve never done something like this before. You will be provided with a phone script, training and a list of voters to call. You’ll need a phone and a laptop computer or tablet to make calls.

**You must RSVP** to receive zoom meeting information.
