**JOIN "TEAM 12 - FLIP TO 26" FOR A VIRTUAL EVENT TO SUPPORT SIX KEY HOUSE CANDIDATES TO WIN 26 HOUSE DELEGATIONS**

**FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2020 - 7PM EDT, 5PM MT, 4PM PDT, 3PM AK, 1PM HST**

**GUEST SPEAKER: U.S. CONGRESSMAN JAMIE RASKIN**

Congressman Raskin (D-MD) is a distinguished Constitutional scholar and professor of Constitutional Law. At this event, Congressman Raskin will inform us about the Twelfth Amendment, and why securing 26 House Delegations will serve as a critical backstop for this election. 

**WE WILL BE READY**

If Republicans can tie up enough electoral votes in post-election legal shenanigans and prevent an electoral vote majority, the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution mandates that the President will be chosen by the House of Representatives.
 
Each state has only ONE vote. Right now Republicans have a majority in 26 state delegations and Democrats in only 22. Two are tied/deadlocked and cast no vote.  Trump would win 26-22.
 
Democrats need to be in the majority in 26 State delegations in the next Congress to prevent Republicans from stealing the election.
 
**FOCUS ON SIX RACES**

The six candidates we are backing are in very competitive races to win or keep the Democratic majority in their states:  Alaska-Alyse Galvin-Independent supported by the Democratic Party At Large:   Iowa:  Rita Hart-Democrat in IA 2:   Michigan: Hillary Scholten-Democrat in MI 3:   Michigan:  Jon Hoadley-Democrat in MI 6:  Montana:  Kathleen Williams- Democrat At Large:   Pennsylvania-Eugene DePasquale in PA 10
