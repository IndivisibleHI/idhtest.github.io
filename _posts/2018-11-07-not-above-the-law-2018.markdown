Donald Trump just crossed a red line, violating the independence of the investigation pursuing criminal charges in the Trump-Russia scandal and cover-up.

Trump putting himself above the law is a threat to our democracy, and weâ€™ve got to get Congress to stop him.

We're mobilizing immediately to demand accountability, because Trump is not above the law.
