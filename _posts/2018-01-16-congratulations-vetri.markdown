Vetri, one of our Elections Team phone bank captains, made waves during the tax scam battle for his [simple-yet-deadly analysis][analysis] of the tax scam's impact on graduate students. **[People][1]** all **[over][2]** the **[country][3]** took **[notice][4]**, including our own Representative Barbara Lee. Although the tax scam passed (ugh), Vetri helped kill the so-called "Grad Tax" provision! Rep. Lee recognized his efforts (along with those of Kathy Shield, a fellow graduate student) with an entry into the Congressional Record and a ceremony as part of the #GOPTaxScam Teach-In last weekend.

If you see Vetri, make sure to tell him "Congratulations!"
