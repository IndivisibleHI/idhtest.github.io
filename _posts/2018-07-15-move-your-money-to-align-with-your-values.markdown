## A Free Workshop to Help People Align Their Money With Their values
*limited seating*

Are you financing dirty energy and fossil fuels, military weapons, private prisons and mass incarceration, the immigration crisis, poverty, gentrification, millionaire profiteers and income inequality? Would you like to find out how to stop supporting these and start supporting a life-giving economy instead? 

Take a look with us at how our financial choices -- banking, checking accounts, credit cards, IRAs, 401Ks, and investments -- are currently financing these destructive activities and how we can choose to spend and invest in socially responsible activities instead. 

Sponsored by:
**CODEPINK** (Jodie Evans and Cynthia Papermaster)
**As You Sow** (Andy Behar)
**Indivisible Berkeley** Economic Justice Team (Steve Murphy and Dave Peattie)
**Fossil Free California** (Sandy Emerson)

This event will be live-streamed and made into a webinar for convenient viewing.
Wheelchair accessible. Refreshments, handouts.
