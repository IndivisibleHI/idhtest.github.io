**GET OUT THE CD-10 VOTE for the June 5 Primary!**

Help us flip a congressional district and check Trump's agenda! be calling voters in Congressional District 10 (Tracy/Modesto area) to make sure we get LOTS of Democrats to to vote in the primary election on Tuesday, June 5 .  If they don't show up in force,  there's a chance there will just be two Republicans on the ballot in November!  CD-10 is a ripe-for-the-taking district, with a Republican congressman in a district that voted by a large margin against Trump in 2016.

What youâ€™ll need: an ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.
