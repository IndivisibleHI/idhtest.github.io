Please show up in support of Fernando, a beloved father and husband who was recently released from ICE detention after 5 months. Fernando's family learned this week that the DHS is appealing his release. He will check in with ICE on this day and we want to make sure ICE knows the community is watching and that they MUST do the right thing and let him come home to his family!
