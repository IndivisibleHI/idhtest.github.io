Second Saturday Textbank | Saturday, October 13th, 2-4pm, RSVP for location. 

This is for new or experienced texters! We’ll be textbanking twice in October (and not in Nov.) for critical candidates for the midterms. We’ll help you get started before you arrive as needed and provide support during the meeting. Opportunities will be waiting in the queue! 

We’ll arrange to be in comfortable homes with good wifi, food and refreshments, street parking and a conducive atmosphere. 

RSVP: To participate, email Steve Cohen at [cohensteve@att.net ](mailto:cohensteve@att.net)for location and support.
