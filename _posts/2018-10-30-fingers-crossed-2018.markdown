Work hard up to and including election day, then join your pals from Indivisible Berkeley, Sister District Project CA-13, Together We Will Albany-Berkeley, Flip the 14, the Albany Democratic Club and Postcards for America - California to watch (and hopefully celebrate) the results.

Drop in anytime after 6pm or **when you are finished phone banking, text banking, knocking, or poll watching**.

SPATS is offering the food and drink and the TVs. Please tip generously!
