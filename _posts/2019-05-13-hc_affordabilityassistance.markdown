And there's a related potential action! 

There are two bills in the California legislature right now that would increase funding to help people with Obamacare pay for their coverage.

Text of letter:

Dear [Legislator],
While the ACA has helped many increase the rate of those with health coverage, there are still too many Californians who still struggle to pay their premiums, copays, and deductibles, and there is meaningful action that you can take to help.

[INSERT YOUR PERSONAL STORY]

I urge you to support [AB 174 (Wood) OR SB 65 (Pan)] and budget investments to increase funding for affordability assistance in Covered California.
