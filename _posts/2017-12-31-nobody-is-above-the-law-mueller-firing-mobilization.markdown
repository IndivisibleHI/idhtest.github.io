Today, President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, imperiling Special Counselor Mueller’s investigation and triggering a constitutional crisis.

You do not find a way to manipulate the Special Counsel because you don’t like the results of the investigation. We are a nation of laws. Many of us know this already, but this is Watergate. Or worse than Watergate.

Join Indivisible Berkeley for a public outcry in protest. Nobody is above the law. *We recommend that you bring a flashlight, signs, and a cell phone.*

Date and Time: Thursday, November 8, 5pm
Location: MLK Civic Center Park, 2134 Martin Luther King Jr Way (Between Addison St. and Allston Way), Berkeley, CA 94704
