**Please take advantage of this opportunity to send emails to CEOs of large, U.S. based corporations, asking them to speak out against voter suppression laws and to support of the national voting rights legislation - H.R. 1 and S.1.**\
\
Ellen Caringer, Ph.D. and Head of Hui Aloha ‘O Maui Indivisible has graciously shared this information with us.

Hui Aloha ‘O Maui Indivisible members Connie Kissinger and Vollie Scott pulled together a list of CEOs from 50 large, US-based companies, all consumer facing, with headquarters around the US. They then worked with Vote.org to pull together a sample email, with specific actions that their members could send to the CEOs.\
\
Here’s a portion of the sample email:

*I urge you to take these actions today on behalf of your company to show your support for American voters:*

1. *Forgo all corporate contributions to the campaigns of any state or federal lawmakers who vote to restrict voting access.*

2. *Call on Congress to pass federal legislation to protect the freedom to vote including: For The People Act (H.R. 1/ S. 1), John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R. 4), and D.C. Statehood (H.R. 51).*

3. *Provide paid time off for all your employees to vote.*

Some of the writers have already received a letter back from American Airlines. The letter said in part:\
*"Any legislation dealing with how elections are conducted must ensure ballot integrity and security while making it easier to vote, not harder. At American, we believe we should break down barriers to diversity, equity and inclusion in our society – not create them."*

**Corporations do listen, so Maui Indivisible has invited others to join them in emailing these CEOs. Go for it!**\
