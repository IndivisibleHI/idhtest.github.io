You may recall that last week the Trump Administration cut advertising for Open Enrollment by 90 percent and cut off significant funding for in-person assisters, so it's that much more important to get out the word.

There's a group of Indivisible grassroots volunteers across the country doing some work to help with this year's Open Enrollment efforts: [Indivisible ACA Signup Project](https://www.facebook.com/groups/153329925218556/).

You can help this week by participating in a [thunderclap that will happen on 9/9](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/61147-aca-signup-reminder). A thunderclap is a fancy way of saying thousands of people posting the same message to social media at the same time to amplify it.
