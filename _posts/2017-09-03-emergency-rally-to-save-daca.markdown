President Trump will make an announcement about the future of the DACA program this Tuesday, 9/5. The latest reports suggest it's likely that the program will be terminated.

DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) protects over 800,000 undocumented youth from deportation and was won through visionary organizing by immigrant youth themselves. DACA has allowed these young immigrants to attend college, work, and live freely without fear of deportation. Now this program is at risk of ending, throwing millions of families into an uncertain future. 

If President Trump announces an end to DACA on Tuesday, we'll join those gathering at the SF Federal Building to show solidarity with DACA recipients and all undocumented immigrants.
