Your vote has never been more important.  Please vote on these propositions and choose your candidates on Tuesday June 5!  Thank you for all you do to support the democratic process.  

### VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 68
Proposition 68 authorizes the state to issue $4 billion in bonds for protecting our environment from climate change, building and improving state and local parks and providing safe drinking water. Delaying these projects will lead to increased costs in the future.  

### VOTE **_NO_** ON PROPOSITION 70
Proposition 70 would put cap-and-trade revenues, which are primarily used to address climate problems, in a new reserve fund beginning in 2024. Spending these funds would then require approval by a 2/3 majority in the state legislature. Current law requires a simple majority. Proposition 70 would empower special interests because deal making would likely be necessary to reach a 2/3 majority. This is undemocratic, opens the door to gridlock and will likely give polluters more say in how these funds are spent. Environmental groups and the League of Women Voters among others encourage voting no. The Chamber of Commerce is one of the few groups supporting this proposition.  

### VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 72
Proposition 72 would enable property owners to install new rainwater collection systems without requiring property tax reassessment. We will all benefit from such additions to our water supply and reducing the energy used to transport water.
