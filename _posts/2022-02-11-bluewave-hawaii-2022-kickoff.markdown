Ready to Win again?

The Indivisible Hawaii team is gearing up to Defend and Expand Our Democratic majorities this November. On Sunday February 27th 4PM HST, we will share our Mid-term strategy, key target states, and crucial races. We will be writing postcards, Vote Forward letters, text banking and calling. Bring a friend or two.  

Let's save ourselves, and of course, let's save democracy.
