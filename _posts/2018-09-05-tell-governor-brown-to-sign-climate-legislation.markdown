### Action
Call or write Governor Brown right away to urge him to sign SB 100 and SB 964.
* Call -  (916) 445-2841  
* Fax - (916) 558-3160
* Write - Governor Jerry Brown, c/o State Capitol, Suite 1173, Sacramento, CA 95814  
* Email his legislative staff - [leg.unit@gov.ca.gov](mailto: leg.unit@gov.ca.gov)   

### Background
The California legislature has passed these climate-related bills:
* SB100 requires the state to have a 100% clean energy portfolio by 2045.  
* SB 964 requires the CALPERS and CALSTERS pension funds to assess the climate-related financial risk of their investments and publish a report on the findings.  

These are hard-fought wins, yet there are concerns that the governor may not sign one or both.
