We may have ICE and Sheriff Livingston on their heels in the Bay Area, but the work of mass resistance has just begun in earnest! Kidnapped migrant children are being interned alone, building sickeningly on the racist family separations of millions under mass incarceration in the U.S. Join the monthly Let Our People Go protest at Richmond's West County Detention Center (WCDF) as we fight back for our peoples!

• HEAR samba band Sistah Boom
• GET UPDATES from political organizers (TBA)
• WRITE letters to individuals detained by ICE
• CREATE at the children's art table
• SHOUT with the Let Our People Go community circle
• And more!

PARKING/TRANSIT ALERT: If you're driving, please carpool if possible! Please try to only use the jail parking lot if you have accessibility issues, are visiting family there, or cannot afford the adjacent parking lot. Others, please pay $3 to park at the adjacent Point Pinole Regional Shoreline/Bay Trail parking lot at 5551 Giant Highway, and walk 0.4 miles (turn left) to West County Detention Facility (WCDF) next door. Another option: the 71 bus to WCDF leaves from Richmond BART every hour.
