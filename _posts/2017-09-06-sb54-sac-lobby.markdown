Join fellow CA residents for a statewide day of mobilization at the state Capitol as we urge assembly members and Governor Jerry Brown to support Senate Bill 54 (CA Values Act).

Senate Bill 54 fights against deportations and ensures schools, health facilities, courthouses, Department of Labor Standards Enforcement facilities, and others are accessible to all Californians.  

When:  September 7, 2017
Time: 9 am - 4 pm
Where: State Capitol 1315 10th St, Sacramento, CA 95814
