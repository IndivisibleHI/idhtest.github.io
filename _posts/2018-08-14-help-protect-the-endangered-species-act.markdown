  Federal Register.** [Click here](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2018-0006-0001)

  of the Endangered Species Act.  \n\n**(2) Share your comments with your members

  Suggested Comment Script for the Federal Register\nI strongly oppose any weakening
  of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as currently proposed by the US Fish and Wildlife
  Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. The ESA was adopted in 1973,
  with overwhelming bipartisan support, and it has been very successful in preserving
  animal and plant species in the US since then. It is also overwhelmingly supported
  by the American people (4 out of 5), who want to see our environment protected and
  a natural heritage left for our children and grandchildren.  \n\nAlthough the ESA
  and its implementing regulations specifically state that species needs should be
  based on the best scientific and commercial data independent of any economic or
  other impacts, the proposed changes would limit the use of science and increase
  the influence of economic factors. Some of the proposed changes include: 1) removing
  automatic protections for threatened species, 2) adding economic factors to endangered
  species determinations, 3) removing regulations requiring federal agencies to consult
  scientists before issuing resource extraction permits, and 4) redefining “foreseeable
  future” - a criteria for assessing threatened species - in a way that would make
  it difficult to assess the real climate change impacts that could harm species.
  \ These and other proposed changes would completely undercut the effectiveness of
  the ESA, and will lead to certain extinction of plant and animal species. These
  proposals would overwhelm already underfunded federal agencies tasked with making
  conservation decisions and delay or negate sound scientific determinations and recovery
  plans. The proposed changes would benefit a small group of commercial interests
  (oil and gas extraction, mining, ranching) to the detriment of our nation’s national
  heritage and the survival of the species with which we share this land. The changes
  would destroy the effectiveness of this highly successful act in meeting its intended
  goal of preserving species.  \n\n\n### Suggested Script for Members of Congress\nI
  have sent the attached comments to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and National
  Marine Fisheries Service regarding their proposals to significantly weaken the Endangered
  Species Act (ESA). Please speak up strongly to oppose this attack on the ESA and
  please oppose upcoming proposed bills in the House and Senate that would greatly
  compromise the ESA protections. Thank you!  \n*[Include your comments to the Federal
  Register in your email to Members of Congress or express them verbally if you are
  phoning]*  "

### Background
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are proposing regulations to drastically scale back protections for threatened and endangered animal and plant species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA was passed in 1973 with overwhelming support by both Democrats and Republicans and has consistently had strong bipartisan support by the American people. It has been credited with saving 99% of the species protected under the Act, including the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and gray wolf.  The ecosystem as a whole has also been protecting as a result of protecting these species, including millions of acres of old growth forest and open space along the Pacific Coast, the Everglades ecosystem and others.  Now the Trump administration is proposing measures that would completely undercut this effectiveness and leave vulnerable species at risk of extinction, while pandering to a small group of congressmen and special interests who have had their sights trained on the ESA for years.  

The proposed changes include: 1) removing protections for threatened species, 2) adding economic factors to endangered species determinations (the ESA’s current implementing regulations state that species needs should be based on scientific and commercial data independent of economic or other impacts), 3) removing regulations requiring federal agencies to consult scientists and wildlife agencies before issuing resource extraction permits for mining or logging, for example, and 4) redefining “foreseeable future” - a criteria for assessing threatened species - in a way that would make it difficult to assess climate change impacts. The proposed regulatory changes would include limits on habitat conservation.  These changes strike at the core of the Act’s effectiveness, which was designed to protect species based on sound science, rather than expedient resource extraction or other commercial land use.  

In addition, Republican senators and representatives have also recently introduced a series of bills to weaken the ESA and codify some of the agency proposals into law. The ambitious legislative package would accomplish numerous longstanding Republican goals for amending the ESA, for example, making it easier for the government to remove species from the endangered or threatened lists and preventing organizations from suing to try to get species protected.
