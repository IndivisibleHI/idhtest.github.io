COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **defeat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  Ohioans voted by mail on April 28th and for the first time since 2008, more Democrats than Republicans voted in an Ohio presidential primary. Unfortunately, many other swing states are not voting by mail despite of 52 COVID-19 cases caused by the in-person primary election in Wisconsin. Letâ€™s get Democrats sign up for absentee ballot. Vote by Mail will make the difference this November. This is our fight. We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing and textbanking from home. We are teaming up with VoteFwd for letter writing, with Open Progress Text-Troop for textbanking, and The Arizona Ground Game for a "pen pal" postcarding.

This training by The Arizona Ground Game is for activists in Hawaii interested in writing postcards to voters in Arizona to sign up for absentee ballot and to turnout the votes for Democratic candidates. This "pen pal" program has four parts, starts in May and ends in November. 
The training will be conducted as a virtual meeting using zoom. **You must RSVP** to get your unique link to the zoom meeting.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. #BlueWaveHawaii Team
