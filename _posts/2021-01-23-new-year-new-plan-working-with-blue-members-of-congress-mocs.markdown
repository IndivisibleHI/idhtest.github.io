This one hour long training session will cover how to work with your Democratic member of Congress. We know there is a broad spectrum when it comes to Democratic members, we will discuss the differences across the Democratic party from progressive Dems to working with conservative Democrats. We will also spend time exploring strategies and tactics for holding your Democratic member accountable during a trifecta. Of course we will leave some time for questions along the way.

**There are two sessions (Feb 4 and Feb 5) which will cover the same material, so there is no need to register for more than one.**
