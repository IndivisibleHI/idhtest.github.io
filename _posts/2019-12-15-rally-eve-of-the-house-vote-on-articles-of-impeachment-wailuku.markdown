Indivisible is joining with other groups from across the Country to tell our MOC's that NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.

The Impeachment Inquiry is now with Jerry Nadler in the House Judiciary Committee.  The next step will be to take the Articles of Impeachment to the full House for a vote.  This can happen before Christmas.

The night before that vote we need to speak up that NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.
