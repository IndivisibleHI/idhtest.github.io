Our next canvassing day will be in Tracy. Please sign up and enlist some friends, too! Email [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com) and [Jeff](mailto:carlockjeff@gmail.com) to RSVP. It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before. These are easy days, and Tracy is only an hour’s drive. Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people. If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, feel free to get in touch with [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com), [Jeff](mailto:carlockjeff@gmail.com) or [us](mailto:elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.
