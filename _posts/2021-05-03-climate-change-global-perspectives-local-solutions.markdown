Dr. Charles "Chip" Fletcher, a UH Manoa authority on sea level rise, will discuss some of the most recent research data on climate change. In addition to being the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), Dr Fletcher is also a Commissioner on the [Honolulu Climate Change Commission](https://resilientoahu.org/climate-change-commission).

\
After Dr. Fletcher's presentation on the science of climate change and its consequences, registrants will have a chance to hear from one of 12 different environmental organizations.\
\
Registrants will be able to choose a breakout session led by one of Hawaiiâ€™s environmental organizations where they will be given a chance to engage on how to take action locally (all sessions will be recorded so folks can go back and hear about as many organizations as they want).

The event is designed for anyone looking to get involved in taking action to address climate change. 

**Please join us for what promises to be a stimulating and informative event. Again, please feel free to share this information with your network.**
