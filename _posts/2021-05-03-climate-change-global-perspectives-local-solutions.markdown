In May, we had a wonderful webinar with Dr. Chip Fletcher, from the University of Hawaii, providing us an incredible presentation on climate change - the basics and root causes of global warming, the extent and impact of the climate crisis, and the actions we must take to mitigate the problems and the inevitable consequences. 

The event was designed for anyone looking to get involved in taking action to address climate change.

Thank you to Dr. Fletcher, our participating organizations, attendees, and organizers - Citizens' Climate Lobby Hawaii and Faith Action for Community Equity - for making this event a reality.
