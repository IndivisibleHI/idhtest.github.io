This is an invite from Sandy Ma, Executive Director, Common Cause Hawaii

Please reserve **Thursday, March 12, 2020, from 6 to 7 pm** for a meeting to discuss where we are on Automatic Voter Registration in the 2020 legislative session. We’ll be providing food and beverages so come prepared to discuss how to move AVR over the finish line and eat!

We’ll have the great Hawaii Public Policy Advocates Steve Teves and/or Melissa Pavlicek discuss the status of the two AVR bills (SB2005 and HB2119) and next steps.

We’ll have our fabulous communications / messenger Dawn Webster discuss the fantastic OpEds / LTEs that have been circulated promoting the benefits of AVR.

We’ll have our social media guru Neenz Faleafine discuss the social media campaign around AVR.

Location of the meeting is at Planned Parenthood Community Room, [839 S. Beretania Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/839\+S\+Beretania\+St,\+Honolulu,\+HI\+96813/@21.3040622,-157.8525008,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x7c006de737660831:0xc565a5903db527e4!8m2!3d21.3040572!4d-157.8503068), Honolulu, Hawaii. Planned Parenthood has plenty of free parking. Enter off of Beretania St.- next to the main entrance, go up the ramp and park in the back of the lot. You may be able to find street parking.

Please let me know if you have any questions / concerns. Many, many mahalos for all the written testimony, in-person testimony, blog posts, and social media likes, shares, etc. that you have all done on behalf of AVR. There are no words to describe how terrific this AVR Hawaii Coalition is! We could not have gotten this far without you and will get AVR passed with you!
