  Hello, my name is (name), and my zip code is (zip code). I'm calling to urge the [Senator/Representative] to vote NO on the gun silencer provision in the "SHARE Act," which would remove regulations surrounding the purchase of gun silencers. Regulation of gun silencers saves lives. Removing the silencer provision in the SHARE Act would ensure that current law—that has been in place for decades—remains on the books. Silencers distort the sound of gunfire, making it harder for victims to flee and first responders to intervene.

  Thank you for your time.

In the wake of the Las Vegas concert carnage, the House is set to move forward with a vote on a [gun lobby-backed bill](http://www.indivisible.org/resource/preventing-gun-violence-tell-members-congress-prayers-not-enough/) that would deregulate the sale of gun silencers, which makes it harder to detect the origin of gunshots. Please, in honor of those who perished last night, write or call our members of Congress today.
