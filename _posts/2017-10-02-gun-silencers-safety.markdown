call-script-text: Hello, my name is (name), and my zip code is (zip code). I'm calling
  to urge the [Senator/Representative] to vote NO on the "SHARE Act," which would
  remove regulations on gun silencers. Regulation of gun silencers saves lives. Thank
  you for your time.

In the wake of the Las Vegas concert carnage, the House is set to move forward with a vote on a [gun lobby-backed bill](https://thinkprogress.org/gun-silencer-vote-a6d777b63eb0/?link_id=6&can_id=f75d3c434ba17355ba5ad69b0ff66f72&source=email-newsletter-102&email_referrer=&email_subject=newsletter-102) that would deregulate the sale of gun silencers, which makes it harder to detect the origin of gunshots. Please, in honor of those who perished last night, write or call our members of Congress today.
