Send text messages to voters, with live support at Drake's Dealership in Oakland! Part of our coalition with Sister District Project CA-13 and Indivisible East Bay. 

Textbanking can be done alone, often done on the fly, but it's more fun and focused in groups where you can grab a beer or a snack, chat with other activists and get unstuck because experienced textbankers will be with you to pull you out of holes. We’re working with **Resistance Labs (formerly Rapid Resist), Open Progress and the ACLU** to help the best candidates and voting-related initiatives to **get America voting**.

We guarantee there will always be opportunities for you waiting in the queue! Work flows should be available two days before the textbook and **we’ll help you get started** before you arrive.

For more information or to RSVP, contact IB Textbanking Captain Steve Cohen at cohensteve@att.net
