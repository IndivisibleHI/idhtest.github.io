In July, after years of pressure from local activists, Contra Costa County Sheriff Livingston announced that he is canceling his officeâ€™s contract with ICE. Currently, more than 150 immigrants are being held at the West County Detention Facility (WCDF), the county jail in Richmond. The relationship with ICE will end this fall.

Now that the contract is being canceled, it is more urgent than ever that the immigrants currently detained at WCDF are released, so that they can be reunited with their families and communities while they wait for their court dates. ICE will likely try to transfer detainees to other facilities, far away from their families and support networks.

Freedom for Immigrants and other local organizations are urgently in need of money and volunteers to help post bond for these detainees.

What you can do to help:
1. **Donate to the Bond Fund!**
Bond for each detainee is in the thousands of dollars. The bond fund has already raised more than $100,000, but they will need more than $1 million to bond out all of the immigrants detained at WCDF. [Donate here.](https://www.aplos.com/aws/give/CIVIC/WCDFFund)

2. **Volunteer to help immigrants and their families navigate the bond-out process!**
Even after raising enough money to post bond, there is a lot of paperwork and hassle involved in getting each detainee released. Freedom for Immigrants is urgently in need of volunteers with availability on weekdays, to communicate with families and detainees, travel to the jail, and fill out paperwork. You do not need any previous experience navigating the court or jail system - they will help you! Training sessions will be held on August 14th and September 11th.
