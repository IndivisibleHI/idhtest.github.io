### Action
Sign your name to this letter to Governor Newsom urging him to address a number of climate change actions and to support proposed state and federal bills on climate-related measures.  

Read the letter pasted below and [sign your name using this form](https://goo.gl/forms/F2GE2098veQza31s2). We will add your information and send the letter on March 19.  

### Background
Governor Newsom has indicated an interest in hearing from Californians about issues of concern, so we are taking this opportunity to write to ask him to take a leadership role in addressing climate change mitigation. As Indivisible Berkeley has a policy of not endorsing any specific bills or positions, the letter will not go out under the Indivisible Berkeley name, but we hope that Indivisible Berkeley members (and others) will sign it as California voters.  

We encourage you to copy this letter and send it to your state senator and representative as well.  

### Letter Text
DATE (to be added when mailed)  

Governor Gavin Newsom  
℅ State Capitol, Suite 1173  
Sacramento, CA 95814  

Dear Governor Newsom,  

We would like to congratulate you on your election as Governor of California and to applaud you for pledging not to accept oil money for your campaign.  We look forward to your strong and progressive leadership as California moves forward to address the many challenges that lie ahead.  

We are a group of East Bay constituents who have been working together since January 2017 to promote climate action; resist rollbacks on existing environmental protections; establish relationships with our local, state and national elected representatives; and educate our members on environmental issues.  

As we all know, California is currently experiencing the severe effects of global climate change, including devastating wildfires, forest die-offs, record heat waves, and predicted long-term drought and water shortages. These effects have occurred even though global temperatures have risen only 1.0 to 1.2 °C above normal. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently issued a report stating that we have a mere 10-12 years to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of a warming planet. The State of California has been a leader in addressing climate solutions, through adoption and renewal of SB 32 carbon pricing, passage of SB 100 to adopt 100% clean energy by 2040, and Governor Brown’s executive order for a carbon-neutral California by 2045. We must continue to be a leader in climate change actions, particularly in light of the current federal administration’s denial and refusal to act.  

Therefore, we strongly urge you to continue to support California’s strong leadership on climate change by taking the following actions to ensure that California deadlines for reducing carbon use, greenhouse gases and other climate pollutants associated with transportation, buildings, industry and agriculture are met, in order to meet the IPCC goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5°C:  
1. Issue an executive order declaring a Climate Emergency in California, which will include guidelines and directives to state boards and agencies.  
2. Phase out fossil fuel extraction by implementing a moratorium on new permits for fracking, gas, and oil extraction and by developing a plan and schedule to phase out all fossil fuel extraction operations in California; require producers of imported fracked oil and gas to mitigate or offset their greenhouse gas emissions.  
3. Develop and implement plans to accelerate EV adoption by cars, trucks, and buses.  
4. Increase funding for public transportation and provide incentives for transit-oriented affordable housing development.  
5. Develop a plan for a just transition to a clean energy economy, including addressing the needs of workers and communities who will be impacted by this transition.  
6. Provide the leadership to update the state’s energy grid to meet the needs of new technologies and green energy needs, while maintaining the state’s energy independence and opposing any regional efforts that may threaten California’s commitment to clean energy.  
7. Support the goals of SB 964 and consider the necessity of climate-responsible investing when appointing CalPERS and CalSTRS board members.  
8. Increase State programs to reduce methane and black carbon emissions and support SB 682 to ensure that these and other short-lived climate pollutants are properly and fully accounted for.  
9. Support strong federal measures to stabilize climate below the 1.5°C Paris Agreement threshold, including endorsement of the principles of the proposed federal Green New Deal and the recently introduced Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Bill (HR 763).  
10. Appoint California Public Utilities Commission members who will advocate for clean energy, energy choice, and the ratepayers, rather than for shareholders and large utilities.  

Thank you for your attention to these climate change priorities. We look forward to your strong leadership and will be happy to support your administration on these issues as we all work together for California, our nation, and our world’s future.  

Sincerely,
