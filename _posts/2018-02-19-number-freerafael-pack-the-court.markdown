Let's pack the court to show support for detainee, Rafael Tolento.

Rafael was working two restaurant jobs to support his family when his father gave him the good news that he had gotten his papers and that he, Rafa, could now apply to get them as well. But when he went to the immigration office to sign the papers, instead they took him to jail. He has been there for over 6 months. His family is spending money they don't have to pay an immigration lawyer, as well as $50/week for telephone calls to jail to keep Rafa's spirits up.

**IMPORTANT TO KNOW:**

* Arrive promptly so we can go into the courthouse together, even though hearings are scheduled to start 30 minutes after the times shown.

* Let the security guard know whose bond hearing you are attending.

* If you have a valid photo ID (driver's license, etc.), please bring it. If you do not, you may ask for an escort to the courtroom.

* Do NOT bring signs (they will be confiscated) or wear movement shirts/attireâ€”our role is to show the judge that the person being detained has the support of the community, simply by our presence in the back of the courtroom. We cannot participate in or be seen as disrupting the proceedings in any way. Thank you for your support!
