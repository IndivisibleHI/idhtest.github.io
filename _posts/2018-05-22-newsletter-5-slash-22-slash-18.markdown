<p>Dear Indivisible Berkeley Community,
</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do.
</p>
<p>
    We wanted to particularly flag an event happening this evening:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Caring for Our Community: a forum on responding to the needs of people who are houseless</strong> | Tonight, Tuesday, May 22, 7pm to 9 pm at The Way Church - 1305 University Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94702. Featuring Pastor McBride, Councilwoman Cheryl Davila, Moni Law of The Way Church, Andrea Pritchett of CopWatch, Big Mama of Dare2Change, Mike Zint of First They Came for the Homeless, Nick Houston of East Oakland Collective, Tiny of Poor Magazine, a representative from Youth Spirit Art Works, Paul Kealoha-Blake, Osha Neumann of East Bay Community Law Center, Boona Cheema of BOSS, Barbara Brust of Consider the Homeless, and a representative of Women’s Daytime Drop-In Center. <a href="https://occupyoakland.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image001.png">Event flyer.</a>
</p>
<p>
    And an upcoming road trip&mdash;our first!&mdash;to Nevada:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoKBTwsHN8TRF9lMxqHxlty-QILjmR0E718iNlsQp4AzI-MA/viewform"><strong>Road Trip! Come to Reno with IB to Register Voters</strong></a> | Friday, June 1st – Sunday, June 3rd. Thousands of voters have been purged from the rolls in Nevada, mostly Democrats. Unsurprisingly this also affects typically disenfranchised populations. We’re working to fix it! We’ll be registering voters via door-to-door outreach with the Nevada Democratic Party. This trip also features an IB-hosted welcome dinner on the Friday night at a brewery!<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/aXE4jBsowMpKjThJ2"> Click here to see the full itinerary, more details, and RSVP.</a>

We are launching regular textbanking with live support at Drake's Dealership in Oakland with Sister District Project CA-13 and Indivisible East Bay. We know textbanking is fast, furious, and often done on the fly. That doesn't mean we can't get together once a month, launch our efforts to help select candidates and causes, have a beer and get questions answered by other experienced textbankers. We are working with Rapid Resist, Open Progress and the ACLU to find strategic opportunities to help candidates and voting-related initiatives to get America voting and going. We guarantee there will always be opportunities for you waiting in the queue.

Join the community circle to resist mass incarceration and immigrant internment at Richmond’s West County Detention Center (WCDF)! Those detained right in our midst are our loved ones, neighbors, co-workers, and classmates. The impact of these racist, cruel separations has enormous economic and social impact on our communities. And the same is true for the general population in jail, who are also unfairly criminalized and detained for lengthy periods before trial. Join community leaders for a one-hour vigil and protest to let those detained know that we are still fighting for them. The site is accessible by car or by the #71 AC Transit bus. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1283494838453152/">RSVP via facebook.</a> To participate in more actions like this, join the <a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/team/immigration">Immigration Team</a>.
