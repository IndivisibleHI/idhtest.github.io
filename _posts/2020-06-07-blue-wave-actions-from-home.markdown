A total of 491,719 (that's less than half million of 128.8 million) votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona led to Trump's win in 2016.  **These 101 electoral votes will lead to the Blue Tsunami for Joe/Kamala** in 2020!  Blue Tsunami because Blue Wave isn't enough!

Ready to call/text/write to 10 left leaning infrequent voters in swing states for Joe & Kamala and to flip the entire Congress blue? Here is a list of our recommended options.  

**Option 1:** 
Join Indivisible Hawaii members on October 4th to celebrate the BIG SEND and to kickoff 30 Day Sprint to the last day of election.  **[Reserve Your Seat](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUscuCvpz4uGtCUJLZHyUGZ_A7lN0rLnWpx)** today.  

Want training?  
* Register [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMlce-vrDwqG93LGlpMbG0ViIU8jeur1adv) to get trained to phonebank to North Carolina
* Register [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZArduGvrjIvHtJMFgItBYBfZcrhY6Qi7Ca0) to get trained to phonebank to Arizona or North Carolina, OR to get set up to write [VoteFwd](https://www.votefwd.org) letters and postcarding

Register [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZArduGvrjIvHtJMFgItBYBfZcrhY6Qi7Ca0) to just call, text, write to voters in swing states with fellow activists.

**Option 2:**
Join volunteers across the nation to call or text eligible but purged voters of color to re-register them.  16 million voters were purged for 2016 election, 4 million more than for 2012 election.  For every one white voter purged, four Latinx voters are purged, nine black voters are purged. Black voter turnout declined significantly in 2016, Latinx voter turnout also declined.

**Option 3:**
Join grassroot activists across the nation to call, text, write, or raise fund for Biden/Harris and other Democratic candidates.  [Find your event](https://togetherfor2020.org/calendar/) by selecting a swing state or event type at https://togetherfor2020.org/calendar/ .

Let's make this happen.  Let's save our lives.  Let's save our country.  Let's save democracy.
