A total of 491,719 (that's less than half million of 128.8 million) votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona led to Trump's win in 2016.  **These 101 electoral votes will lead to the Blue Tsunami for Joe/Kamala** in 2020!  Blue Tsunami because Blue Wave isn't enough!

**Option 3:**
Join volunteers across the nation to call or text eligible but purged voters of color to re-register them.  16 million voters were purged for 2016 election, 4 million more than for 2012 election.
