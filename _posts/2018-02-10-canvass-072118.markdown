We will be canvassing on Saturday, July 21st in CD10. 

It will likely be in Manteca or Modesto and the hours are still being determined! (We have placeholder times in this post.) 

To sign up, email our [canvassing captains](canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org). 

It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before.  Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people. 

If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, feel free to get in touch with our [canvassing captains](canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) or [us](mailto:elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.
