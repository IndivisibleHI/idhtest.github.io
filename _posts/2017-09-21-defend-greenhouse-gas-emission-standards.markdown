call-script-text: "(Unique comments are best, so if you have time, craft one of your
  own.  If not, please use the script below.) \n\nI am concerned about my family’s
  fuel costs, our health, and the harm caused by more frequent weather extremes.  Overwhelming
  science shows that these extremes are caused by global warming. They harm the safety
  of my family, our property and our financial security.  The 2021-2025 Greenhouse
  Gas standards are reasonable, cost-effective, and technically feasible with controls
  already in use on many vehicles.  The existing standards will save billions in consumers’
  fuel costs ($1.7 trillion over the life of the program) and create health and safety
  benefits that far exceed the minimal cost of attaining the standards. So far most
  manufacturers have surpassed the standards while having record-setting sales, showing
  that the standards are achievable and good for everyone. According to DOE analysis,
  the transportation sector is becoming the largest source of GHG emissions, and these
  standards are a reasonable way for automakers to do their part.  \n\nWe should not
  waste taxpayer money to reevaluate the standards when EPA exhaustively reevaluated
  and upheld them just last year in the most comprehensive federal assessment of vehicle
  technology ever done.  EPA’s study used National Academy of Science recommendations,
  peer-reviewed research, industry experience, and robust public comments.  EPA’s
  study demonstrates that the standards are, without question, appropriate under the
  Clean Air Act.  Furthermore, the standards will save 12 billion gallons of oil,
  giving the US far greater energy independence at far less cost to manufacturers,
  consumers and the environment than increasing domestic energy production.   I ask
  the EPA to maintain the existing 2021-2025 GHG standards.  "

Comment to maintain greenhouse gas (GHG) standards established by the Obama Administration. 

## Background
Experts consider the Obama-era GHG standards to be the single biggest action taken by any country to address climate change. Cars, SUVs, and light trucks account for about 45 percent of all U.S. oil consumption and are responsible for nearly 20% of climate pollution in the U.S., and the total transportation sector is becoming the largest source of GHG emissions in the country. The Trump Administration has proposed weakening greenhouse gas (GHG) and fuel economy standards for vehicle model years 2021-2025.  Their first step is a joint EPA/National Highway Transportation Safety Agency request for comment on whether these standards are appropriate under the Clean Air Act.  Lowering GHG emissions (primarily carbon dioxide) and improving fuel economy are closely linked.  In January 2017 EPA completed its report on the most comprehensive federal assessment of vehicle technology ever done, using National Academy of Science recommendations, peer-reviewed research, industry experience with adopting technologies, and public comments.   They found that the standards are technically feasible with existing technology, at even lower cost than originally estimated.  Consumers would benefit from reduced fuel costs and lower pollution.  The net benefits far exceed the costs of the program.
