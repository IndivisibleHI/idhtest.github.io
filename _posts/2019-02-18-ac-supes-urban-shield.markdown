### How We Got Here

Last September, we held a powerful rally outside the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office during what was the final Urban Shield war games training. The rally corresponded with the People’s Climate Mobilization, and centered the importance of fighting militarization and building community strength and resilience in the face of the increasing natural disasters our planet is facing.

Since then, and into this year, an Alameda County Ad-Hoc Committee appointed by the Board of Supervisors has met and finalized a report for what disaster preparedness in the Bay Area can and should look like without Urban Shield. The committee has provided powerful recommendations to the Board of Supervisors geared toward community-based emergency preparedness, de-escalation, and demilitarized disaster response. The recommendations include:

 -   Eliminating SWAT teams and competition from emergency preparedness exercises
 -   Eliminating the weapons expo that puts private interests and weapons manufacturers above the goals of whole community preparedness
 -   Ensuring that the majority of people responsible for implementing exercises are from the key disciplines of Fire and Emergency Managers, as well as community organizations serving vulnerable populations, rather than most being law enforcement
 -   Changing the name “Urban Shield” for exercises
 -   Dedicating $5 million of funding for the Health Care Services Agency and Social Services Agency to carry out emergency preparedness training and exercises

As we anticipated, Sheriff Ahern is in denial about losing the fight for Urban Shield and is scrambling. This is business as usual for the Sheriff – to attempt to completely ignore decisions made by the Board of Supervisors that were the result of community organizing.

Yet the Stop Urban Shield Coalition has built power, and the Sheriff will not succeed – when we act to protect these gains. As both common sense and evidence shows, the violence of policing will never create healthy and resilient communities, but is rather a public health threat. Let’s be ready to defend our tremendous victory this year, and build the demilitarized, community-centered alternative to Urban Shield!
