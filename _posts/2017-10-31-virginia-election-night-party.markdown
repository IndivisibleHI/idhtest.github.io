# UPDATE: HAPPY PARTY TONIGHT! COME TO PAPPY'S DOWNSTAIRS AREA

We've done a lot of amazing work together this past season to support our candidates in Virginia. (We aren't there yet! Keep doing it!)
On election night, let's gather to break some bread, have some drinks and watch the Virginia election results live with other East Bay folks who wrote postcards, called, and texted VA voters. Come what may -- we will celebrate, commiserate, or do some of both.

We may even Skype/facetime with some folks at parties in Virginia.

Hosted by:

- Sister District Project of CA 13,
- Indivisible Berkeley Elections Team
- Together We Will Albany-Berkeley
- Berkeley Women's March Huddle
