We'll decide on an action for IB to host the first week of March and start assigning responsibilities. We'll also talk about a plan for escalating/continuing actions if this "national emergency" situation does not get resolved. 

In the interim, we strongly recommend everyone continue to call our Members of Congress every day: [https://indivisibleberkeley.org/action/fake-emergency-calls](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/action/fake-emergency-calls).
