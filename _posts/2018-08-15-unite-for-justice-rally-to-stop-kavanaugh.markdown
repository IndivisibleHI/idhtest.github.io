Join us at the Civic Center in San Francisco on August 26 from 1pm to 3pm to protest the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. This is part of a [National Day of Action organized by NARAL and MoveOn.org](https://act.moveon.org/event/unite-for-justice/21198/signup/) to demand that the US Senate stop Kavanaugh from being confirmed. Rallies will be held in all fifty states.  

Kavanaugh’s rulings and writings have been against women’s reproductive rights, voting rights, the environment, LGBTQ rights, and immigrants rights. His confirmation could be devastating to hard-fought-for rights in all these areas. In addition he supports increasing presidential power.  

Local supporters include the Women’s March Bay Area Group, the San Francisco Democratic Party, and Now California. National supporters include the American Federation of Teachers, Working Families Party, Planned Parenthood Action Group, CREDO and Daily Kos.  

Please help us support this important rally.
