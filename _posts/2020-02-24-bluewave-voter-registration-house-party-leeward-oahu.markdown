We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to Beat Trump and to Flip U.S. Congress Blue during the 2020 election.

Join us to write follow up postcards to register new Democrats in Colorado, and North Carolina.

We will provide names & addresses, letters, postcards, stamps, and the training. You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters. We welcome donation of stamps (either 55 cents or 35 cents) and/or cash.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote.
