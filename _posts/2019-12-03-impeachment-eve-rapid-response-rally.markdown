# **Join with Indivisible and other groups from across the Country to tell our MOC's that NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.**

Right now the Impeachment Inquiry is with Adam Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee.  When this committee completes its investigation it will send conclusions to the House Judiciary Committee which will determine if the evidence indicates impeachable offenses. If the decision is to impeach then the Judiciary Committee will draft the Articles of Impeachment.

Then the full House will have to vote on whether to move forward with the charges included in the Articles of Impeachment.

The night before that vote we need to speak up that **NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.**
