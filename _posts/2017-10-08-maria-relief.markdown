  Hello, my name is [name] and I'm calling from zip code [zip code]. I'm calling about disaster relief aid to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. I am happy that the [Senator/Representative] has called for increased aid [you can mention the specific item listed below]. Still, I want to see her do these two specific things to ensure that the millions of Americans without food, water, electricity or shelter get the help they need:

  1.
    a. [Senators] Demand that an emergency aid package be passed the week the Senate returns from recess.

    b. [Representative] Demand that an emergency aid package be passed this week, before October recess.

  2. Demand the Jones Act be amended to not apply to areas that receive federal disaster aid.

  Thank you for your time.

Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands were destroyed by Hurricane Maria, yet Congress and President Trump have been slow to provide material aid and relief funds to these American islands. Our Members of Congress have pushed for increased aid, but we can help them do more.

Senator Feinstein [signed a letter](feinstein_letter) to President Trump demanding he provide more funding, material aid, and personnel to the recovery effort.

Senator Harris [questioned](harris_question) acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on why the department's response has been so slow, particularly on waiving the Jones Act, which would allow more ships to travel to Puerto Rico to deliver supplies.

Representative Lee [called on Congress](lee_statement) to authorize more relief funding to Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Texas and Florida.

All of these statements are good to hear, but what we want to see is action. Please call our three Members of Congress and tell them to do what it takes to get an emergency relief package passed, and to amend the Jones Act so that it does not apply to areas that are receiving federal disaster aid.
