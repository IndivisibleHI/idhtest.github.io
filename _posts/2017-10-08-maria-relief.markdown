Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands were destroyed by Hurricane Maria, yet Congress and President Trump have been slow to provide material aid and relief funds to these American islands. Our Members of Congress have pushed for increased aid, but we can help them do more.

Senator Feinstein has [signed a letter](feinstein_letter) to President Trump demanding he provide more funding, material aid, and personnel to the recovery effort.

Senator Harris [questioned](harris_question) acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke on why the department's response has been so slow, particularly on waiving the Jones Act, which would allow more ships to travel to Puerto Rico to deliver supplies.

Representative Lee
