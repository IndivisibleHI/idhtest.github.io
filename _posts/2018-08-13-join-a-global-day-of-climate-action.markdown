On September 8 the San Francisco Bay Area is joining thousands of cities and towns across the world to [Rise for Climate](https://riseforclimate.org/), a  global day of grassroots action to promote a just and fossil-free future.  The rallies and events are scheduled the week before Governor Jerry Brown’s Global Climate Summit, which will take place in San Francisco.  Our local event is slated to be the “largest climate march the West Coast has ever seen.”  

Local organizations including 350 Bay Area, the Asian Pacific Environmental Network (APEN), California Environmental Justice Alliance (CEJA), PODER, Service Employees International 1021 (SEIU 1021), Idle No More, North Bay Organizing Project, Jobs With Justice and many others, are supporting this local action.  

**When:** 10:00 am September 8
**Where:** Embarcadero Plaza, San Francisco
**RSVP:** [CA Rise for Climate](https://riseforclimate.org/)  

We will send a reminder to our [e-mail list](environment+subscribe@indivisibleberkeley.org) and updates as the event draws near.  We hope you will participate!
