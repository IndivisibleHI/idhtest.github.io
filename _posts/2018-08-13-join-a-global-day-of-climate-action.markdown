March with IB at the [RISE for Climate, Jobs and Justice Global Day of Climate Action](https://ca.riseforclimate.org/homepage/) on Sept 8 in San Francisco!  Marches are taking place [across the globe](https://riseforclimate.org/) prior to Governor Brown's Global Climate Summit in what is hoped to be the largest climate march in history.  We are part of the "We Rise for Democracy" contingent that will gather at Embarcadero Plaza between 10:00 and 11:00.  Look for our banner there and join us!  The march will start at 11:00 and end with a muraling project and resource tables at Civic Center Plaza.   

350 Bay Area, one of the RISE for Climate, Jobs and Justice organizers, is asking for anyone with a spare room or couch if they will help house marchers from out of town.  Hotels are expected to be full that week, and participants may not have the resources to pay for accommodations in this very expensive market.  350 Bay Area has set up a housing board, and we would like to encourage members and friends to help if they can.  You are guaranteed to meet some committed, friendly people - and you'll be playing an important role.
