  **Caller**: Hi! I’m a constituent from Berkeley. I’m calling to urge [MoC] to act immediately because Trump just crossed a red line. The Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, has talked openly about shuttering the Mueller investigation and how he’d do it. Trump is obviously trying to interfere in the investigation and called it a “hoax.” I want to urge [MoC] to publicly call for Whitaker to recuse himself and for a congressional investigation into Trump’s obstruction of justice.

  **Staffer**: Thank you for your call. [MoC] is monitoring the various investigations closely and is letting them run their course.

  **Caller**: That’s good, but it’s really important for Congress to assert its power now to protect the investigation and hold Trump accountable. Can I expect [MoC] to issue this statement immediately?

  **Staffer**: I’ll pass that along to [MoC]

  **Caller**: Great, I’ll be following to see if [MoC] speaks out on this.

Thing are still moving, and there may very well be more developments. While it’s important to focus and continue to resist the Trump agenda simultaneously, we can also work now to protect the Mueller investigation as it unfolds. Here’s how:

All Americans need to be clear that we will not stand for this. Indivisible is teaming up with a coalition of groups to host **emergency rallies at 5 p.m. local time on Thursday, November 8.** Attend the Berkeley rally at Civic Center Park!

Tell Congress to act. Every Member of Congress should be immediately and publicly calling for two things:

- Matthew Whitaker must recuse himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation

- Congress must launch investigations into Trump’s obstruction of justice—and Democrats should be publicly committing to do so when they take control of the House in January.

There is no longer “nothing we can do” about Trump’s antics. The Democrats will take over the House of Representatives in January and we will demand that they prioritize using their new powers to hold Trump accountable.
