Let's "pen pal" registered Democrats and left-leaning Independents who didn't vote in 2018 in Arizona Legislative District 11 to turnout for the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mark Kelly and other Democratic candidates this November.

33 members of Indivisible Hawaii signed up back in May to "adopt" 1385 of 10000 in Arizona LD11 as pen pals.  The Arizona Ground Game team still have 2500 left to be adopted.  It will require two postcards and one phone call/texting OR two phone calls/texting and one postcard.  

**Must RSVP/register** on SwingLeft to receive the zoom information to join.  Email natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org if you need postcards.
