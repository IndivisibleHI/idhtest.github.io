### Election Day!

Join your Berkeley neighbors to Get Out The Vote in the Central Valley (CA-10) and in Nevada! These two races are some of the closest in the nation and we want to make sure everyone there is voting!!! Help us flip these seats to win a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate!

WHAT YOUâ€™LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon!
Finnish Hall

Emails from us will have "Indivisible Berkeley" in the subject line.
