We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump** and to **Flip U.S. Congress Blue** during the 2020 election.

Join us to write letters to register likely Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.  

We will provide names & addresses, letters, voter registration forms, stamps, and the training. You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters.

Also mark your calendar every third Wednesday 5PM to 7PM February to September.  Please RSVP so we can inform you of location where we will meet on the Leeward Oahu side.  

When we Vote, We Win. 
When we write, We Vote.
