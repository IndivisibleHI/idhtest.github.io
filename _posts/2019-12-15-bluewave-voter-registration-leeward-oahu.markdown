We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump** and to **Flip U.S. Congress Blue** during the 2020 election.

Join us to write letters to register likely Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.

We will provide names & addresses, letters, voter registration forms, stamps, and the training. You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters.

When we Vote, We Win. 
When we write, We Vote.
