Our canvassing trip out to Tracy in CD-10 last weekend was [a great success!](https://www.facebook.com/BerkeleyIndivisible/photos/a.1316056851771230.1073741828.1306889019354680/1531603886883191/?type=3&theater)! Our next canvassing day will be Saturday, September 9 in Tracy again with Vecky Elliott. Please sign up and enlist some friends, too! Email [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com) and [Jeff](mailto:carlockjeff@gmail.com) to RSVP. It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before. These are easy days, and Tracy is only an hour’s drive. Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people. If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, feel free to get in touch with [Billy](mailto:billymcdonaldnp@gmail.com),  [Jeff](mailto:carlockjeff@gmail.com) or [us](mailto:Elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.
