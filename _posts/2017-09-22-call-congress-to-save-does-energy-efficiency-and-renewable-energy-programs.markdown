  **Suggested Script for Senators (personalize if possible):**

  Hi, my name is \[NAME\] and I’m a constituent from \[CITY, ZIP\].

  I’m concerned about cutbacks in DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs, and I am pleased that the Senate subcommittee has proposed a bill that is far better than either the president’s proposal or the House bill.  However, because EERE programs are critical to common-sense climate change solutions and to providing national energy savings, I urge you to restore full funding as the budget process continues.   Furthermore, please ensure that the final bill includes no riders.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

  **Suggested Script for Representatives (personalize if possible):**

  Hi, my name is \[NAME\] and I’m a constituent from \[CITY, ZIP\].

  I’m concerned about cutbacks in DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs.  These programs are critical to common-sense climate change solutions and to national energy savings.  EERE programs took the biggest cuts - $985M - in the House DOE budget proposal. Among the cuts is the elimination of DOE’s Advanced Research Project-Energy (ARPA-E) grant, yet these grants have benefited companies and institutions, created jobs, supported innovation, contributed to national energy savings, and are part of the first line of defense against climate change.   As the budget process goes forward I urge you to restore funding for these programs and to pass a bill with no riders.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

## Background

The House Appropriations Committee budget proposal for DOE applied the most significant cuts (~-50%) to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and eliminated the Advanced Research Project-Energy (ARPA-E) grant program.  In contrast, DOE’s nuclear weapons programs would receive $1B more than this year’s budget. The proposed Senate budget is better; it restores and increases funding for ARPA-E grants.  However, there are still cuts to EERE programs.  EERE programs and grants provide jobs, support innovation, improve national energy efficiency and contribute to addressing climate change.
