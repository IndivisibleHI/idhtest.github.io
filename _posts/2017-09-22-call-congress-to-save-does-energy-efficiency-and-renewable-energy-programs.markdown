**UPDATE 12/11/17:  The focus now is on reconciliation between the House and Senate Appropriations Bills.**

The House Appropriations Committee budget proposal for DOE applied the most significant cuts (~-50%) to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and eliminated the Advanced Research Project-Energy (ARPA-E) grant program.  In contrast, DOE’s nuclear weapons programs would receive $1B more than this year’s budget. The proposed Senate budget is better; it restores and increases funding for ARPA-E grants.  However, there are still cuts to EERE programs.  EERE programs and grants provide jobs, support innovation, improve national energy efficiency and contribute to addressing climate change.
