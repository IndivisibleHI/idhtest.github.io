call-script-text: "Hi, my name is \\[NAME\\] and I’m a constituent from \\[CITY, ZIP\\].\n\nI’m
  concerned about funding for DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)
  programs because EERE programs are critical to common-sense climate change solutions
  and to providing national energy savings.  I urge you to ensure that the final budget
  bill includes full funding for these programs and no policy riders.     \n\nThank
  you for your time and attention.\n\n\\[If leaving a voicemail, leave your full street
  address to ensure your call is tallied\\]\n\n~~**Suggested Script for Representatives
  (personalize if possible):**~~\n\n~~Hi, my name is \\[NAME\\] and I’m a constituent
  from \\[CITY, ZIP\\].~~\n\n~~I’m concerned about cutbacks in DOE’s Energy Efficiency
  and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs.  These programs are critical to common-sense
  climate change solutions and to national energy savings.  EERE programs took the
  biggest cuts - $985M - in the House DOE budget proposal. Among the cuts is the elimination
  of DOE’s Advanced Research Project-Energy (ARPA-E) grant, yet these grants have
  benefited companies and institutions, created jobs, supported innovation, contributed
  to national energy savings, and are part of the first line of defense against climate
  change.   As the budget process goes forward I urge you to restore funding for these
  programs and to pass a bill with no riders.~~\n\n~~Thank you for your time and attention.~~\n\n~~\\[If

**UPDATE 12/11/17:  The focus now is on reconciliation between the House and Senate Appropriations Bills.**

The House Appropriations Committee budget proposal for DOE applied the most significant cuts (~-50%) to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and eliminated the Advanced Research Project-Energy (ARPA-E) grant program.  In contrast, DOE’s nuclear weapons programs would receive $1B more than this year’s budget. The proposed Senate budget is better; it restores and increases funding for ARPA-E grants.  However, there are still cuts to EERE programs.  EERE programs and grants provide jobs, support innovation, improve national energy efficiency and contribute to addressing climate change.
