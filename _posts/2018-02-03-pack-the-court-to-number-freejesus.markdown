Join us as we demand justice for Jesus Medrano, a father of 4 U.S. citizen children, who was unlawfully and violently detained during an ICE raid in Fair Oaks, California last November. Jesus's children are hurting, especially his 5 year old who suffers from a medical condition. With increased threats of ICE raids in California, it's time that we hold ICE accountable. Jesus is scheduled to have a bond hearing next week on Wednesday, and we're showing up to demand #Justice4Jesus! 

Rally: 12:00pm
Hearing Time: 2pm
