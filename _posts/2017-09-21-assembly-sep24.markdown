#### State Senator Skinner

California lawmakers recently wrapped up one of the most progressive legislative sessions on record—approving: the "sanctuary state" measure, SB 54;  [a package of bills addressing CA's affordable housing crisis](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-legislation-deal-impact-20170915-story.html); legislation that steps in to embrace environmental and land-use policies, as a push back against the Trump administration, and other important policies..
Bring your questions and thoughts for what's sure to be a lively and informative discussion regarding recent legislation, bills signed into law by the Governor... and what's on the horizon.

Elected to the Senate in November of 2016, Nancy Skinner represents California’s 9th Senate District, where she has been a strong social justice advocate, energy and climate change trailblazer, and accomplished legislator.  She completed three terms in the State Assembly before being elected to the Senate where she's served as chair of the Senate Public Safety Committee, and on numerous other Committees.

Senator Skinner began her public service in 1984 as the first and only student to be elected to the Berkeley City Council. On Council Skinner introduced the nation’s first Styrofoam ban and co-founded an international association of cities, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability. After her term on the City Council, Skinner served as Executive Director of ICLEI’s US office and International Director of ICLEI’s Cities for Climate Protection program which engaged cities worldwide to take action to stop climate change.
