Tell Trump administration officials in person that you don't want them to drill for oil off the cost of California. Join the IB Science & Environment Team and the Center for Biological Diversity in Sacramento on Feb. 8 for the "listening session" and a pre-session protest.

Sam and MaryAnn are organizing our involvement. You can email us at info@indivisibleberkeley.org.

**We recommend you take the CBD bus from Oakland**, available for a pay-what-you-want fee starting at $0. [Click here](https://www.universe.com/events/oakland-bus-to-protest-against-offshore-drilling-at-boem-public-hearing-tickets-oakland-HT789C) to purchase your bus ticket. *Make sure to say you're with Indivisible Berkeley* when it asks which group you're with!

If you want to carpool or drive on your own, please let us know by emailing us at info@indivisibleberkeley.org.
