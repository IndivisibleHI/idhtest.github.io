Learn how to call Colorado Voters for the Colorado Democrats, and give it a spin yourself!

In November, Colorado voters will be crucial in taking back the White House and flipping the Senate.

SwingLeft is working with the Colorado Democrats to call voters in CD-3 to learn about the issues that most concern them and their families. This helps to hold officials accountable, and to build up a robust Democratic platform that reflects the needs of Coloradans!

Don't worry if you have never done this before. Once you sign up for this event, you'll get an email with links to all the information you need to prepare for this training & to make calls.  **You must RSVP** on SwingLeft.

Youâ€™ll need a phone and a laptop computer or tablet to make calls.
