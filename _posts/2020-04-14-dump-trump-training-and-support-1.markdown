COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  Volunteers across the nation wrote, texted and called registered Democrats in Wisconsin on April 7th. Liberal Judge Jill Karofsky defeated the incumbent supported by Trump by 11 point. About 71% of the voting was by absentee ballot. This is the trial run for November election in swing states. This is our fight.  

We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing and texting from home.  We are teaming up with VoteFwd for letter writing; with SwingLeft and Environmental Voter Project (EVP) for textbanking. We will write and text to registered Democrats in swing states to get them signed up to Vote by Mail.  

RSVP using the link below and you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the zoom meeting.

During past three months, we together wrote 1300 letters and 800 follow up postcards to register new Democrats in Colorado and NC.   We also took 2400 Vote by Mail/GOTV letters to write at home to registered Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and NC!  Mahalo .  

When we Vote, We Win.  When we write, We Vote. When we text, We Vote.
