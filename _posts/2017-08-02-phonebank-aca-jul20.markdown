**Let's keep the pressure on!**  

Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans are working overtime trying to make deals with “holdouts.” They plan to move toward a vote on the cruel Trumpcare bill, as soon as they think they have enough support. Now more than ever, we need your help to keep the pressure on and undercut their efforts.

* Save the ACA Phone Bank
* Thursday, July 20, 4-8 PM
* Ed Roberts Campus, 3075 Adeline St, Berkeley (**[map][1]**)

Join other IB members and local activists as we call Nevada to ensure that Senator Heller remains a firm NO vote. We're calling to encourage his constituents to keep the pressure on!! Trumpcare would deprive the nation's most needy of essential services, defund Planned Parenthood, and includes other elements that will remove over 20 million from health coverage through expanded Medicaid. Allowing the bill to pass would be a travesty, and we can't let that happen!

Take the elevator from the Ashby BART directly to the Ed Roberts Campus. Please bring a fully charged cell phone, along with a laptop or device, earbuds if you have them, and a friend! We'll provide refreshments, and all the rest.

BART strongly encouraged. Parking available at the ERC, or Ashby BART lot.
