Why Michigan? Remember 2016? Due to partisan gerrymandering and voters' rights restrictions, Republicans hold a drastically unfair advantage and are over-represented in the Michigan state legislature. Itâ€™s critical for Democrats to win seats in 2018 to make blue inroads in this presidential battleground state -- before 2020. So we're partnering with [Sister District](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/teams/california/ca13) and phoning for Democratic candidates Mallory McMorrow (for State Senate) or Padma Kuppa (for State House of Representatives).

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details!
