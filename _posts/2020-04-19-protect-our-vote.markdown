Right now, our Democracy is under threat. While health experts urge Americans to stay home, too many states fail to offer options for voters to cast their ballot in a safe and accessible way. While state governments consider adapting their voting laws in response to the crisis, the reality is that states lack funds to implement the vital reforms needed. The Wisconsin primary disaster is a prime example of why we must take action now.

Our guests will discuss the need for swift action from Congress to secure our right to safely vote in our elections this year and the solutions that will allow us to do just that. In order to win the $4 billion in funding necessary for the states to protect our democracy in the next federal COVID 19 relief package, we must demonstrate the overwhelming public and political support, across party lines, for the vital solutions necessary to protect our health and our elections, including vote-by-mail, expanded early voting, and other key reforms.

But we need your help! In this town hall we will also teach you how to take action so that you can ensure no American has to choose between their health and their right to vote.
