  Hello, my name is [name] and I am a constituent from Berkeley. I am horrified that Trump just abused his power to declare a fake emergency. He is going around Congress and the will of the people to get his way. Congress must do everything in its authority to stop this antidemocratic power grab. Will [Member of Congress] commit publicly to supporting a resolution to terminate this false emergency? Will she also publicly call for investigations into this abuse of power?

  Staffer: The Senator/Representative is very concerned with Trump’s declaration and is monitoring the situation.

  [For Lee and Harris] OK, but posts on Twitter are not enough. I expect the [Senator/Representative] to use her elected position to help solve this problem, starting with a press release and a public commitment to vote to terminate this false emergency.

  Staffer: I’ll pass your thoughts on to the Senator/Representative.

  [For Feinstein] Thank you for your press release on Friday declaring the emergency to be based on falsehoods and inflammatory rhetoric. I am looking to Senator Feinstein to go further by publicly supporting the termination of this emergency and calling for investigation and oversight.

  Staffer: I’ll pass your thoughts on to the Senator,

  [For All] I will be closely watching for [MoC]’s statements and actions on this. Donald Trump is the national security risk and I am looking to [MoC] to stop him. Thank you for your time answering phone calls and for all the work you do.

## Briefing

Calling every day will demonstrate that we are not just going to forget about this problem. In addition to phone calls, Indivisible Berkeley is working on a short- and medium-term strategy for in-person action related to this fake national emergency.

This script will be updated as information changes.

Please read through the script before you make your calls. There are some sections for just one or two MoCs, so you might have to skip to a lower section in the middle of the call.

Please report the outcome of your phone call if the staffers provide you with any information not already listed on this page! Email info@indivisibleberkeley.org

Here is the current public stance of each of our MoCs.

- Rep. Barbara Lee status: No press release
- Senator Dianne Feinstein status: Press release!
- Senator Kamala Harris status: No press release
