call-script-text: "*Personalize your comment whenever possible with your own experiences,
  knowledge and interests.*\n\nI urge NOAA to maintain all current protections for
  marine sanctuaries and national monuments and to maintain the boundaries as they
  exist today.  I live near the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and oppose allowing
  energy or mineral exploration or any interference with this natural area.  The exquisite
  and unique sanctuaries and monuments provide nursery and spawning habitat for commercial
  fish and threatened fish.  They are rich in cultural, ecological and scientific
  significance.  Forty-two million visitors generate $8B a year to support coastal
  and ocean dependent communities whose businesses depend on thriving sanctuaries
  (National Marine Sanctuary Foundation).  Public participation in the designation
  or expansion of these areas was extensive and wholly adequate, and local communities
  currently enjoy the opportunity to provide advice and recommendations on their management.
  We should maintain and protect with pride these outstanding natural treasures.    "

## Background

Pursuant to Executive Order 13795, Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy, NOAA is reviewing the status of marine sanctuaries and marine national monuments designated or expanded since April 28, 2007.  Criteria for review are: assessment of acreage, budget impacts, costs of management, whether adequate consultation was performed, and the opportunity for potential energy and mineral exploration and production within or near the sanctuaries or monuments. More information on these rich environments, including a list of sanctuaries and monuments at risk and their economic, recreational, ecological and climate protection value can be found here [Monuments for All](http://monumentsforall.org/marine/) and  the [National Marine Sanctuary Foundation](https://www.marinesanctuary.org/take-action/advocate/standupformarinesanctuaries/)
