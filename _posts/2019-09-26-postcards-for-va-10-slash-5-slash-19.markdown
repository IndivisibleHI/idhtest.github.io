JUST A FEW WEEKS TO GO BEFORE THE NOV 5TH VIRGINIA ELECTION!

The purpose of this effort is to help flip the Virginia statehouse blue by reaching out to voters with handwritten postcards up and down the state. **We can help turn Virginia Blue by flipping just one more seat in Virginia**. We write. We Vote. We WIN!
 
We will meet at the second floor of Varsity Building - free parking in front of the building.
