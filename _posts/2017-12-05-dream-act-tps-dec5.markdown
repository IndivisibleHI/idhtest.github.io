call-script-text: "[Note: Senator Harris already took the DREAMer pledge! She needs
  a thank you and encouragement to STAND STRONG this week. And a reminder to protect
  TPS recipients as well.]\n\n[For Senator Feinstein and Representative Lee:]\nCaller:
  Hello! My name is [name] and I’m calling from Berkeley. I'd like to know about [Rep.
  Lee's/Sen. Feinstein's] position on passing the DREAM Act with this week's Continuing
  Resolution.\n\nStaff: Well, she definitely supports the DREAM Act. And definitely
  voted \"No\" on the tax bill last week [distraction!]. \n\nCaller: That’s great,
  but it’s going to take more than talk and tweet storms to keep 800,000 DACA recipients
  from falling into Trump’s deportation machine. Will the [Senator/Representative]
  take the “DREAMer Pledge”? The DREAMer Pledge is a commitment to vote \"NO\" on
  any Continuing Resolution that does not include the DREAM Act.\n\n[Note: if the
  Sen/Rep says she will take the DREAMer Pledge, ask to get that in email form. As
  soon as you hang up, please email us at [info@indivisibleberkeley.org](mailto:info@indivisibleberkeley.org)
  to let us know that we're making major progress!]\n\nCaller: Please also prioritize
  protections for some of the most vulnerable immigrants who *are* documented, those
  who have Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Thank you!"

The tax battle is sent back to the house, and more importantly, *the Senate and House must BOTH pass a spending bill by the end of this week!*

### Now's our chance to win protections for the DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants!

The DREAM Act would make permanent the protections for immigrants who arrived in the US as young children, aka DACA/DREAMers.

Trump's newest targets are tens of thousands of Haitian refugees (from the 2010 earthquake and cholera epidemic) and other refugees who were granted so-called "Temporary Protected Status" (TPS) to stay in the US while their countries rebuild. Trump has decided to end TPS for these refugees.

Call our Senator Dianne Feinstein and tell her she is not allowed to approve the spending bill ("Continuing Resolution") unless it includes the DREAM Act. Also give Senator Harris and Representative Lee a call to thank them for already pledging to vote "NO" on the CR unless it includes the DREAM Act. (And in *all three* calls, also urge them to enact protections for TPS recipients.)
