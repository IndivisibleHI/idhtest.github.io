Join the community protest of mass incarceration and immigrant internment at the Richmond jail, aka West County Detention Facility (WCDF) - which is both a county jail and an ICE detention facility. Asylum applicants from the border are often relocated there, so those whoâ€™ve had their kids taken away from them may be held at WCDF. 

The cruel, racist separations rent by immigration, policing and cash bail policies deal terrible emotional and economic injuries on our loved ones, neighbors, and communities. We must fight to free our peoples!
