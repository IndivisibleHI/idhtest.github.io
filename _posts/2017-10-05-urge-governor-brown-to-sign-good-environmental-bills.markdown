  Governor Brown's phone number: (916) 445-2841

  Dear Governor Brown,

  My name is \[NAME\] and I'm a constituent from \[CITY, ZIP\].

  The legislature has passed many good bills that will help protect California’s environment and public health. I want to make sure you know that I would like you to sign the following bills:

  **AB 262 (Bonta) Buy Clean California Act.** This bill employs the state’s massive purchasing power to recognize manufacturers who have invested in producing less climate pollution.

  **AB 523 (Reyes) Electric Program Investment Charge Allocation.** This bill would dedicate funds for specific clean energy projects benefiting disadvantaged and low-income individuals.

  **AB 890 (Medina) Preventing Developer Abuse of the Initiative Process.** This bill limits the use of ballot initiatives on developments and prevents developers from abusing a loophole that allowed projects to bypass the California Environmental Quality Act.

  **AB 1414 (Friedman) Rooftop Solar Permits Fees.** This bill will help make solar systems more affordable and desirable to potential solar customers by continuing protections put in place against unchecked permitting fees.

  **SB 801 (Stern) Energy Storage Solutions.** This bill directs the utilities to deploy additional energy storage capacity as an emergency procurement to address near-term electric grid needs due to the limitations at the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility. That facility produced massive leaks of methane in 2015-16.

  Thank you for your attention to these bills and for your leadership in the effort to address climate disruption.

Indivisible Berkeley's Science & Environment team is partnering with the Sierra Club California to support these key environmental bills in California. Sierra Club California takes positions on hundreds of bills. While many of those passed the legislature, a handful required extraordinary effort by Sierra Club supporters all over the state to make sure legislators knew to support the bills.

Now that some of these critical bills have passed in the legislature, we need one more action to get them over the finish line: Governor Brown’s signature.

If you do not have time to call, you can also sign the [Sierra Club action alert here](https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/California?actionId=AR0089065&id=7010Z000001OkLCQA0&data=20b7972fd5aab699c2e6fad3435bdc4da8c1e8899ff1df1dc6d3d2d44e458eafea5b4848dd3d0e3d031cedfeafcc0234).
