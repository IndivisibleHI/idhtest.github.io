  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  As the budget process moves forward, I urge you to protect funding for scientific research and development (R&D) in all federal agencies, especially ARS, DOE, EPA, NIH, NIMH, NOAA, NSF, NSTC and USGS. The research budgets of many universities and scientists depend on grants from these agencies. The quality of our future depends on advances in scientific research and investment in promising new technologies. The partnership between our federal government and universities has led to many discoveries and much innovation improving the quality of our lives. Please empower the expert scientists both in and out of government and their programs as they continue to strive to protect and improve our health, safety, environment and future possibilities. China is rapidly increasing its spending on research and development and its number of new patents is increasing annually, while the number of new US originated patents has not been growing. We need to maintain our leadership in R&D.

  Thank you for your time and attention.
