  Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I urge you to oppose S 951, the Regulatory Accountability Act.  This act would place exhaustive requirements on agencies developing protective regulations and would place short-term economic and energy interests above public health and the environment.  My family depends on the safeguards established by EPA and other agencies to ensure we have safe air, water, land, food, household products and working conditions.  The intent of this bill is to make those safeguards impossible to achieve, and it is unnecessary because studies show that the economy prospers when people and the environment are healthy.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

This bill has already passed the House and has been ordered reported out of committee in the Senate. It is another in the slew of bills aimed at preventing future regulatory protections.
