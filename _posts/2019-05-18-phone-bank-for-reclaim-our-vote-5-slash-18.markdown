Help combat voter suppression in heavily gerrymandered Virginia. 

We're calling "inactive" and "unregistered" voters in Virginia to make sure they are registered to vote in 2019, when voters choose members of the state legislature. In 2017, 1 vote decided control of the House of Delegates. Each voice deserves to be heard, and each vote matters.

We're partnering with our local Sister District friends to support Reclaim Our Vote, a coalition of voter rights organizations. Please RSVP and join us!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.
