2019 is an important election year in Virginia! Help make sure every eligible voter has an opportunity to participate. 

In partnership with our local Sister District friends, we're helping the Reclaim Our Vote Campaign, calling "inactive" and "unregistered"votersto make sure they are registered to vote in 2019.  This is a nonpartisan effort to reach out to under-represented voters who may otherwise be removed from the voting rolls. 

The Virginia primary is on June 11th. Voters must register by May 20th to participate. 

If you are new to phone banking, there will be training available. 

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.
