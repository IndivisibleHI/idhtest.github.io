**In this bluest of blue states, our delegates to the U.S. House of Representatives are still dragging their feet on whether or not to vote for impeachment.**  The House vote is currently scheduled for Wednesday, December 18.  

**CALL Ed Case** (Congressional District 1, Honolulu) **and Tulsey Gabbard** (Congressonal District 2, all other parts of Hawaii) to remind them that NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW and they need to step up and take action to hold the President accountable.
