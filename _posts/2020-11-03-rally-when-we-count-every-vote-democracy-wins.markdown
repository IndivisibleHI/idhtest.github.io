## **Our win is in sight, and we must remain steadfast and project calm, determined confidence that the will of the people will prevail.**

## **Right now it is more important to celebrate that with every hour the Harris/Biden Campaign lead increases.**

## **There are millions of votes still outstanding. So, for now, we celebrate and remain on deck should we need to act.\
 STAY TUNED.**

### **See below for prior notice on planned rally that has been cancelled as of today, Nov 4, 2020.**

Indivisible Hawai’i and the Democratic Party of Hawai’i are joining with ***[Protect the Results](https://ProtectTheResults.com)***, a nation-wide coalition committed to upholding the rule of law and safeguarding the final, legitimate results of the 2020 Presidential Election by holding events across the country to calmly demand that every vote be counted.

The Protect the Results coalition includes Indivisible, Stand Up America, Sierra Club, Stand Up Republic, Black Lives Matter, NARAL, Move On, Greenpeace, End Citizens United, Everytown and many others.  Should Trump try to stop counting ballots or challenge the results, the coalition is organized to take action to ensure that all votes are counted and that there is a peaceful transfer of power.

**In Honolulu, we will mobilize on Wednesday, Nov 4, 2020 from 4:30-6:00 pm at the State Capitol (Beretania Street side).**

* In the event that Donald Trump loses the election and refuses to concede or undermines the results, we will take action to protect our democracy by demanding that all votes are counted and that we have a peaceful transition of power.

* If Donald Trump concedes, we will celebrate our democracy, honor our fellow citizens who worked so hard to cast their ballots, and get ready for the hard work ahead to heal America and live up to the promise.

**IMPORTANT:**  Wear a mask and practice social distancing along the sidewalk around the State Capitol.  We must stay on the sidewalk, not on Capital grounds.  Please do everything possible to remain safe.
