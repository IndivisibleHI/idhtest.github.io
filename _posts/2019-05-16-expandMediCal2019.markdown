•	Lack of access to health coverage harms immigrant communities and our health care system
•	Undocumented Californians are the largest single group of uninsured individuals in the state – to get to universal coverage we must expand eligibility to everyone
•	Health care is a human right, and our health system is stronger when everyone is included
•	Federal attacks makes ensuring access to health coverage for all more urgent than ever
Two bills: SB 29 (Durazo) & AB 4 (Bonta, Chiu, Santiago) would expand Medi-Cal coverage to all income-eligible adults, regardless of immigration status
