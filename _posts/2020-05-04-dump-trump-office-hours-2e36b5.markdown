COVID-19 means we need to Vote by Mail to **defeat Trump and flip U.S. Congress Blue** in 2020.  Ohioans voted by mail on April 28th and for the first time since 2008, more Democrats than Republicans voted in an Ohio presidential primary.  Unfortunately, many other swing states are not voting by mail despite of 52 COVID-19 cases caused by the in-person primary election in Wisconsin.  Let’s get Democrats sign up for absentee ballot.  Vote by Mail will make the difference this November.  This is our fight.
We will provide you the tools and training to step up your letter writing and textbanking from home. We are teaming up with VoteFwd for letter writing; with Open Progress Text-Troop for textbanking.  

We are holding weekly office hours for you to "drop in" to ask questions or to just chat about 2020 national election.  The office hours will be virtual meetings conducted using zoom. **You must RSVP** to get your unique link to the zoom meeting.  

When we Vote, We Win.  When we write, We Vote.  When we Text, We Vote.
