Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate. Think Supreme Court -- and let's put work to put a check on the Republican agenda!

WHAT YOUâ€™LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon!
Location TBA

Then look for an email with subject 'Indivisible Berkeley" in the next few days so you'll know where to go!
