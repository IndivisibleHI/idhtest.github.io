Please come out and demand a progressive, community based vision to replace Urban Shield.
This will be the last meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on UASI, which was established by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in March 2018 in response to sustained community concerns about Urban Shield, which is funded in part by UASI grants from the Department of Homeland Security, and coordinated by the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. 
The Board decided that 2018 would be the last year the county would approve Urban Shield, as currently constituted, and asked the Ad Hoc Committee to make recommendations to the Board on the UASI-funded emergency preparedness training and exercise in 2019 and beyond.
This meeting is open to the public and is a chance to make our voices heard.
