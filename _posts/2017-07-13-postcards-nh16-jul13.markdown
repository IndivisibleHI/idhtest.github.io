Kevin Cavanaugh is running in in New Hampshire for the District 16, State Senate Special Election scheduled for July 25. It is a special election because the democrat who held the seat passed away. He is endorsed by Maggie Hassan, and the teachers union.  He supports women having a full range of health care choices (code for pro-choice).

Join the Elections team on Thursday night - **let's keep it BLUE.**  Postcards, addresses and stamps will be here. An orange cone will be on the roof of my car.
