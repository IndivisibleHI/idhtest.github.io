READY to write to keep Virginia Blue?  In 2019 Indivisible Hawaii Blue Wave team with thousands of other volunteers and millions of voters turned the Virginia Legislature Blue, winning a majority in both Chambers.  The Democratic Legislature along with the Democratic Governor delivered for the voters with Medicare expansion, gun safety, ending the death penalty, and with increased funding for transportation, education and jobs.

Now we need to persist by reelecting and expanding our Blue majority in the November 2, 2021 Election.  We know that off, off year elections are decided by turnout.  We know that personal postcards to voters increases turnout. We know that our Blue Wave Hawaii team writes great postcards. Please join us to WIN.
