Please join our team meeting, where we will discuss issues of national and local importance in racial justice and criminal justice, including police (de)militarization and Urban Shield, criminal justice reform, the Alameda County Sheriff’s race (2018 election), and native peoples’ rights (West Berkeley Shellmound).
