Items for discussion will include issues in Berkeley Policing, updates on re-configuring Urban Shield and other matters of concern on the city and county level. New Participants welcome!

*Note - As a courtesy to the neighbors, please do not park on the Cul de Sac. Please park on Hillcrest Rd and walk down. It is close to a bus stop but steps are steep up to the house. The house is about a mile from the Rockridge BART.
