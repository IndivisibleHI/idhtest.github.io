(This post to be updated as our Sam finds time to add more to it!)

### Pre--General Assembly

Our pre-GA this month was dedicated to the Women's March. We had a sign-making party (music courtesy Jaime) with tons of clever slogans and boundless energy and excitement!

### Opening

IBer Ann-Marie led our community in a sing-along of "Ain't gonna let nobody turn me round!" Including everyone's favorite line, "Ain't gonna let no Trump turn me round!"
