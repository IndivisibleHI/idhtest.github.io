30 days to go until the election day of our life time. Letters and postcards to over 20,000 voters have been mailed. Ready to pivot to call and text another 20,000 voters? Ready to continue to write VoteFwd letters?

Learn about competitive races in swing states and various phonebanking and textbanking opportunities which can maximize your time. Be ready to SHARE YOUR ACTIONS OR SIGN UP FOR ACTIONS to **dump Trump** and **flip the U.S. Senate** blue. Just 2 hours a week will let you reach out to a lot of people in key states. Bring your friends and family. We can do this!

You must **RSVP/register** to receive your unique link to join the zoom meeting.

BlueTsunami because BlueWave isn't good enough!!!
