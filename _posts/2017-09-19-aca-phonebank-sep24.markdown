## It's that time again

With John McCain on the fence again about repealing the ACA, we've got to mobilize fellow progressives in Arizona to call his office and make it clear that repeal is not acceptable.

Join OFA at the Finnish Hall on Sunday from 1-4 for a phone bank to *Save the ACA*!

#### A note on the location: the phone bank will be in the Ski Lodge room, whose door you access from the parking lot.
