Trump won Arizona in 2016 by only 3.9% and Joe is currently leading by 4.6%. Yeah we can win Arizona this election!

Call to turnout votes for Joe/Kamala for White House and Mark Kelly for U.S. Senate.  You **[must RSVP](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMoc-2sqjIqH9ZVZQ6sOtC4lflu1Pl1Dh2G)** to receive zoom information and instruction.

Agenda (times in Hawaii time which is 3 hours behind Arizona time):
* 4PM Training

Don’t worry if you’ve never done something like this before. We’ll train you, provide a phone script and a list of voters to call.  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J9vREXbXlM&feature=youtu.be) to hear from other volunteers.

You’ll need a **phone and a computer or tablet** to make calls.
