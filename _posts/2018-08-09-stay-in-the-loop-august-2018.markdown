Our pre-GA training for August will be on how to stay in the loop with IB. This session will be great for new members or folks who want to receive more information from certain issue teams. IB Economic Justice team lead Dave will be leading the training.

This training will take place in the Finnish Hall Cafe, which is downstairs and accessible via a side entrance from to the parking lot.

Immediately following this training, join us for our [August General Assembly](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/event/ga-august-2018)!
