The Trump-Pence administration's gag rule is a dangerous and unconscionable attack on our health and rights. It includes language specifically designed to block people from care at Planned Parenthood health centers. The gag rule also makes it illegal for health care providers in the program to refer patients for an abortion.

This puts health care at risk for four million patients and keeps patients from getting information about all of their health care options â€” including 1.6 million Planned Parenthood patients.
