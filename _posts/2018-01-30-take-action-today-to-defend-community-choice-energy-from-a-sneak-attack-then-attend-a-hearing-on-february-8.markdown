### Action
Oppose the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC’s) action to freeze Community Choice Energy in California, and be part of California’s resistance to Trump’s dirty fossil fuels agenda.

### Show up for the press conference and hearing in San Francisco
California Public Utilities Commission February 8, 2018 at 8:30am 
505 Van Ness Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102 (off Civic Center BART)

### Background
Community Choice Energy is a statewide policy that allows cities and counties to take control of their electricity - where it comes from and what kind of energy it is (California AB 117).  In Alameda County the community effort by the East Bay Clean Power Alliance has been to advocate for local clean energy though our Community Choice program.  PG&E would love to see programs like this fail.  Now, newly forming Community Choice programs are under attack by monopoly utilities (like PG&E) and this time the threat is coming through the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as a resolution (E-4907) that would freeze new Community Choice Energy programs. The CPUC has no authority to oversee Community Choice programs!  You can read more about the CPUC resolution E-4907 here. Such a freeze will put new Community Choice programs into debt and out of business.  This sneak attack came while most people were preparing for the Christmas/New Years holiday and travels. We need your help to stop this threat in its tracks!

**Thank you for supporting Community Choice Energy and the transition to clean energy.  And for all you do!**
