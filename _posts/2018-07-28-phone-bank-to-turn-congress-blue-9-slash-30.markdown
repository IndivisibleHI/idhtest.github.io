Help phone Nevada voters to help Jacky Rosen win a seat in the US Senate! Remember, the Senate confirms Supreme Court and other federal nominees. The Nevada Senate race is a toss-up -- we need all hands on deck NOW!

WHAT YOU"ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

SORRY, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCEPT MORE SIGNUPS FOR THIS EVENT NOW due to limited space. But if you'd like to sign up, we can let you know if space opens up!
