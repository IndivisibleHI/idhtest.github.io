Help send Jacky Rosen to the Senate from Nevada! The Senate confirms Supreme Court nominees; enough said?  We’ll be supporting the Nevada State Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign for Jacky as well strong candidates for the House and for state offices. 

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
