Help flip nearby CD-10! Let’s send Democrat Josh Harder to Washington and turn Congress Blue! This won’t be an easy fight – Republicans are pouring money into the district to shore up the incumbent. But Harder is a strong candidate, and we can win this if we all work together to make it happen!

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
