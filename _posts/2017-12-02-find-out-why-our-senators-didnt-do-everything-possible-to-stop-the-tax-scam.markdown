  **You**: Hello, my name is <name> and my zip code is <zip code>. I'm a constituent from Berkeley, and I'm calling about the tax bill that passed the Senate yesterday. I noticed that the Senator did not use every available Senate procedure to slow down the Senate in advance of the tax bill vote.

  **Staff**: The Senator repeatedly spoke out against the bill and also voted No for it. And this bill was passed with reconciliation, so there was nothing the Senator could do.

  **You**: That's not what I'm talking about. During the ACA repeal battles over the summer, the Democrats made a big deal about withholding consent on *other* normal Senate business. That effort slowed down the Senate and gave more time for opposition to build. That tactic worked. What happened this time?

  **Staff**: <some response>

  **You**: That's not really an excuse. I also know that your phone lines have been ringing off the hook for at least a week with people demanding you use these tactics to slow down the Senate.

  **Staff**: Well what do you want the Senator to do about it now?

  **You**:

  - First, I want the Senator to vote NO on anything that comes out of conference.
  - Second, I want the Senator to stand by the Democrats' commitment to include the DREAM Act in the upcoming funding bill. The Senator and the other Democrats have a lot of leverage on this funding bill and I expect them to use it to pass the DREAM Act.

Our Senators had the opportunity to force the Senate to grind to a halt for the last few weeks, in advance of Friday's tax scam bill vote. But they didn't. Instead, they let the Senate proceed with "business as usual," AKA Republicans forcing through a bill that at least half the Senators did not have time to read, that the American people overwhelmingly oppose, and that would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for a tax cut for corporations and the wealthy. (And it would repeal ObamaCare.)

**Call our Senators, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, and ask them why they did not do everything possible using Senate procedures to slow down this bill.**

This plan isn’t "tax reform." It’s tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of our communities.

3,969,800 California families would see a tax increase
