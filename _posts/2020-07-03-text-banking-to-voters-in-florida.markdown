We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** this November. 

If we win Florida, that's 29 electoral votes for Biden.  Join Environmental Voter Project to text environmental voters in Florida to sign up to vote by mail.  Yes COVID-19 situation is really bad in Florida and we need all left-leaning voters to vote by mail.  

The texting will be done using the Hustle software platform which means you don't need to use your phone.  The training will be conducted by EVP staff as a virtual meeting using zoom. **You must RSVP** to get zoom meeting information.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
