EPA will hold a Listening Session on its proposed withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan on February 28 at the San Francisco Main Library, Koret Auditorium, [30 Grove Street, San Francisco,](https://maps.google.com/?q=30+Grove+Street,+San+Francisco&entry=gmail&source=g) from 8:30am-7:30pm.  The Clean Power Plan is the signature achievement of the Obama administration to reduce carbon emissions from the the power sector.  
**RSVP to Phyllis Rothman (rothmanp@hotmail.com)** to join Indivisible Berkeleyâ€™s Science and Environment Team, along with other Indivisible and environmental groups to make our presence and comments known at 2:00 pm at the Grove Street entrance.  
**To enter the Listening Session,** you must register with EPA [at this site](https://www.epa.gov/stationary-sources-air-pollution/forms/san-francisco-listening-session-repealing-clean-power-plan).  When registering you may elect to make a statement. Register early, as registration will close on Feb. 21 or when all available slots are filled.  
**Submit written comments** - In addition to making a statement, we encourage you to submit written comments in order to ensure your concerns become part of the official record.  This may be done at the Listening Session or via [Regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0355-14998) (or both).  See IB's Call to Action for background and suggested comments here: [Stop EPA from Withdrawing the Clean Power Plan](https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/action/comment-to-stop-epa-from-withdrawing-the-clean-power-plan).  You may also contact Bruce Hamilton of the Sierra Club and IB, 415-977-5678, bruce.hamilton@sierraclub.org if you would like more tips on how to make a statement or comment.  Comments do not have to be technical.  You may present what you are seeing in your community resulting from the impacts of climate change. We will make an impact with our presence.   
Please feel free to attend at a different time if you cannot join the group at 2:00.  We expect that other Indivisibles and environmental groups will be protesting to oppose withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan during other parts of the day.
