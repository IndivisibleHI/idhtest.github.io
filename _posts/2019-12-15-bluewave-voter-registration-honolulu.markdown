We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump** and to **Flip U.S. Congress Blue** during the 2020 election.

Join us to write letters to register likely Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.  

We will provide names & addresses, letters, voter registration forms, stamps, and the training.  You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters.

Mark your calendar every third Saturdays January to September 3PM to 5PM at Democratic Party Hawaii HQ in Honolulu.  

When we Vote, We Win. 
When we write, We Vote.
