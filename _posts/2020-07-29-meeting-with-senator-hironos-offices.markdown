Staff from Senator's Honolulu and DC offices will be meeting with us. The Senator's schedule is very dynamic, but if possible, she will also join us.

We'll meet you in the comfort and safety of your home or wherever you choose to  socially distance, e.g. It's another Zoom meeting!

Register in advance for zoom meeting at
https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZckfuypqj0uE9xhbR9_DtmHy_6NCuUEIg-1

After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.

The main focus of the meeting will be concerns about the use of force against peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square and Portland.

Alan Yamamoto provided this background info.

Senator Merkley filed an amendment and attempted to offer it to the National Defense Authorization Act but he could not. Senator Hirono cosponsored the amendment.
 
He then introduced the amendment as a bill, S.4220. It currently has 41 cosponsors and Senator Hirono was an original cosponsor. The stand alone bill is available here, but the bill text is not yet available. It should be available ahead of the Zoom meeting on August 4.

Don't forget to register!
