Textbank
Saturday, June 9, 2-4
Drake's Dealership
2325 Broadway, Oakland

We are launching regular textbanking with live support at Drake's Dealership in Oakland with Sister District Project CA-13 and Indivisible East Bay. We know textbanking is fast, furious, and often done on the fly. That doesn't mean we can't get together once a month, launch our efforts to help select candidates and causes, have a beer and get questions answered by other experienced textbankers. 

We are working with Rapid Resist, Open Progress and the ACLU to find strategic opportunities to help candidates and voting-related initiatives to get America voting and going. We guarantee there will always be opportunities for you waiting in the queue.
