## It's that time again

With John McCain on the fence again about repealing the ACA, we've got to mobilize fellow progressives in Arizona to call his office and make it clear that repeal is not acceptable.

Join OFA at the Ed Roberts Campus on Thursday from 5 to 8 for a phone bank to *Save the ACA*!
