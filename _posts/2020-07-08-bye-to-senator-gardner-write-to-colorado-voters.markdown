We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.  

Join Swing Left staff and volunteers from around the country for a virtual letter writing party supporting races up and down the ballot in Colorado. It’s fun - we’ll have Colorado tunes and trivia as we write letters!

**You must RSVP** to receive instructions on how to join this letter writing party. Never written letters before? Hop on to votefwd.org/swingleft and make an account; download twenty letters from Vote Forward’s Colorado campaign; and we’ll show you how to write them at our virtual party!

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
