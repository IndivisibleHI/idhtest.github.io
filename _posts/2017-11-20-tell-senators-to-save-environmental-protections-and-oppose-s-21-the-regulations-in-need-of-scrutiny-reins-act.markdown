  Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I urge you to oppose S 21, the REINS Act.  This act would allow Congress to cancel regulations based on politics, rather than scientific merit and prevent similar regulations from ever being enacted again.  It would allow Congress to take away protections my family depends on to keep make our air, water, land, food, household products and working conditions safe.  I want agency experts to establish protections using strong science, rather than politicians who represent special interests over the health and safety of all Americans.  This act is hazardous to Americans and a dangerous precedent.  Please vote no.

  Thank you for your time and attention.

The REINS Act has already passed the House and been ordered reported out of committee in the Senate.  It is one of a slew of bills aimed at rolling back existing regulatory safeguards and preventing future protections. It would allow Congress to cancel regulations that have satisfied all regulatory requirements, including public comment, based on politics, alone, and would disallow any future similar regulations.
