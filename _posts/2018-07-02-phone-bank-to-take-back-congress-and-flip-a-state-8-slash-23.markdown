Angry enough? Time to gear up and work together for wins in November – and put a check on the Republican agenda! We’re targeting strategically important areas and will call for one of these campaigns at each phonebank: 1) Nearby Congressional District 10 (Tracy/Modesto) where Democrat Josh Harder is challenging the Republican incumbent; 2) the Nevada Senate Race and coordinated campaigns for state offices; the Nevada Senate seat is a “must-win” for Democrats to take back the Senate and prevent more right-wing judicial confirmations; 3) In partnership with [Sister District](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/teams/california/ca13) we’re working for Democratic contenders for the State House and Senate in Michigan, where Republicans controlling state government have imposed voters’ rights restrictions and gerrymandering that threaten to rig the 2020 presidential election in this battleground state.

WHAT YOU’ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.
