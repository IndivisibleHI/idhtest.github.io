This is our regular team meeting. Doors at 7pm for set up and socializing; meeting begins at 7:30pm.

The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

Come join us! New folks are very welcome.
