  Hello! My name is [___] and I’m calling from [part of state]. I’m calling to thank [Congresswoman / Senator __] for voting against the budget resolution in the [House / Senate] earlier this month.

  Will the [Congresswoman / Senator] also oppose the Trump tax bill itself when it’s time for a vote? [wait for answer...we expect all 3 of our MoCs to say "yes"]

  That’s great. I’m very glad the [Congresswoman / Senator] thinks we don’t need to slash basic services to give the wealthy a tax cut. Will the [Congresswoman / Senator] commit to me that she will do everything she can to slow down and expose the Trump Tax Scam? [For Senators, including withholding their consent?]

  [If Yes:] Thank you! That's what I expect from my elected officials, and you have my support to stop this tax scam!

  [If No:]
  That’s what I expect out of the [Congresswoman / Senator]. It’s not enough just to vote no, she needs to actively work to slow down the Trump Tax Scam and expose it for the scam it is: one that makes promises to the middle class while only delivering benefits to the rich and corporations. Please take down my contact info so that you can let me know what the [Congresswoman / Senator] is doing to stop this scam.

### Direct from Indivisible National HQ!

Let’s be clear: the Trump Tax Scam is a massive giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, paid for by raising taxes on some middle class families and slashing critical social programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They want to eliminate taxes that only affect the wealthiest individuals and let corporations pay even less than they already do. Almost all of the tax benefits from the Republicans’ plan will go to the top 1%, which will exacerbate our country’s massive racial wealth gap.

The fight in Congress over the Trump Tax Scam is happening right now. Republicans want to use the special process in the Senate called “reconciliation” to pass the Trump Tax Scam with only 51 votes (just like they tried with health care). To use reconciliation, the House and Senate have to pass a consensus version of their budget, which they did when the House passed the budget by a 216-212 vote on October 26 (every Democrat in both chambers voted “no”). Now, they’ll get started on the Tax Scam bill itself—we expect them to release their draft of the legislative text on November 1.

The Republicans want to speed the Tax Scam through as fast as possible so that you don’t have time to figure out that it’s a bad deal. We need Democratic MoCs to stand up and do whatever they can to slow down this bill so we have time to fight it—including, for Senators, withholding their consent. Call your Democratic MoC today, and tell them that you expect them to do everything in their power to push back against the Trump Tax Scam.
