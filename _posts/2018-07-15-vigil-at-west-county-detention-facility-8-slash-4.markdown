In July, Contra Costa County Sheriff Livingston announced that he is ending the contract with ICE to hold immigration detainees at the West County Detention Facility in Richmond. This represents a major victory for advocates who have pushed for years to end the contract with ICE - but it will not be a real victory until those currently detained are released and reunited with their families, friends, and community, and those already transferred to other states are returned.

Join the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity for a vigil at WCDF, to call for detainees to be reunited with their families and for a complete end to cooperation between the Sheriff's office and ICE.


Parking/Transit Alert: Parking is limited at WCDF. If youâ€™re driving, please carpool if possible! Please try to only use the jail parking lot if you have accessibility issues, are visiting family there, or cannot afford the adjacent parking lot. Others, please pay $3 to park at the adjacent Point Pinole Regional Shoreline/Bay Trail parking lot at 5551 Giant Highway, and walk 0.4 miles (turn left) to West County Detention Facility next door. Another option: the 71 bus leaves from Richmond BART every hour and stops at WCDF.
