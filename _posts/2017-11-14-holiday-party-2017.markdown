The resistance has had a productive year! Join us at the Berkeley Fellowship of Unitarian Universalists on December 17 for the Indivisible Berkeley Holiday Party!

Great food and drink; communing with friends and comrades; Inspiring live performances by Coral Majority, Occupella, Vukani Mawethu; and, the evening finale--dancing to Motown tunes. Bring can goods to donate to Alameda County Food bank.
