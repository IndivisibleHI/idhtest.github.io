<p>Dear Indivisible Berkeley Community,
</p>
<p>Thank you for everything you do. 
</p>
<p>This week, at the top, we want to highlight a local opportunity flagged by our Immigration Team:
</p>
<p><strong>Volunteers Needed: Accompanying Immigrants, Hosting Refugees.</strong> The Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity advocates for immigrants and refugees in the Bay Area and around the country. Rev. Deborah Lee spoke to Indivisible Berkeley at a General Assembly last year. They are now seeking volunteers to: accompany undocumented immigrants to check-ins with ICE and/or provide shelter for 1-3 months for refugees. For more info and to volunteer, contact: Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, 510-948-7899, <a href="mailto:info@im4humanintegrity.org">info@im4humanintegrity.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
    And, for those of you considering <strong>how to fill in your June 5th vote by mail ballots or sample ballots</strong>, consider joining our happy hour, where folks will be given the option of delivering a 1 minute toast to the item of their choice, helping to inform our decisions and, equally importantly, giving us a chance to hang out with each other.
</p>
<p><strong>Sample Ballot Mark-Up Party</strong><br>Date & Time: Wednesday, May 30th, 7-9pm<br>Location: Hotsy Totsy, 601 San Pablo Ave.
    <br>
    RSVP: <a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/event/sample-ballot-mark-up-party">Here</a>

<p><a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/action/vote-no-confidence-in-sheriff-ahern"><strong>Considering Writing In “No Confidence” in on June 5th ballot re: Alameda County Sheriff.</strong></a><strong> </strong>Please consider voting "no confidence" in Sheriff Ahern on the June 5th ballot, and sharing this information with your friends, neighbors, and other groups you're involved with. While Sheriff Ahern is running unopposed, he does not represent the values of our community and others in Alameda County. Current Alameda County Sheriff Ahern is up for re-election and is running unopposed. Sheriff Ahern subverts local immigrant protection laws, supports ICE, hosts Urban Shield, promoting the militarization of local police forces, is a registered Republican and Trump supporter, and supported Jeff Sessions’s nomination for attorney general. Alameda County deserves a sheriff committed to protect the residents of our communities. Our cities have passed laws to demonstrate this commitment. <a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/action/vote-no-confidence-in-sheriff-ahern">Learn more here.</a>

<p><a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/event/spreadthevote_052018"><strong>Meet Kat Calvin, founder of Spread The Vote</strong></a><strong> |</strong> Sunday, May 20th from 4pm to 5:30pm at the Connie Barbour Room, BFUU, 1606 Bonita Ave. As of 2016, over 30 states require some form of identification at the polls - a new kind of poll tax. These laws are designed to suppress voter turnout for the young, the elderly, and minorities – the very groups that are in dire need of more representation in our government. The fight to end this poll tax is back. Come learn about how one grassroots organization -- <a href="https://www.spreadthevote.org/">Spread the Vote </a>-- has taken on this fight in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Virginia and Tennessee by tackling the four biggest challenges faced by the targeted groups: money, time, transportation, and bureaucracy. For more details, contact <a href="mailto:voterrights@indivisibleberkeley.org">voterrights@indivisibleberkeley.org</a>. <a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/event/spreadthevote_052018">RSVP</a>.
