HB1248 HD1SD2CD1 providing Vote by Mail was passed last session and signed into law as Act 136.  The Act provides that elections in Hawaii starting with the 2020 elections shall be under this Act.  

The Hawaii Legislature Judiciary Committees of the House and Senate have called on the Chief Election Officer of Hawaii and the County Clerks of Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, and Honolulu to provide a briefing on the status of the implementation of Vote by Mail to insure that we are ready for the upcoming 2020 elections. 

This is an opportunity to hear from those directly responsible about problems being encountered and solutions being proposed.  We need to keep the pressure on to remind our government that voting is front and center in a free democracy.
