We need 22 additional electoral votes and 5 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump** and to **Flip U.S. Congress Blue** during the 2020 election.

Join us to write letters to register new Democrats in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and North Carolina.  

We will provide names & addresses, letters, voter registration forms, stamps, and the training.  You bring the enthusiasm and powerful words to talk with new voters.  We welcome donation of 55 cents stamps and/or cash.

Mark your calendar every third Wednesday January to September 5PM to 7PM at inside cafe of Down to Earth in Kailua.

When we Vote, We Win. 
When we write, We Vote.
