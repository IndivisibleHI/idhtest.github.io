Indivisible National is excited to announce the launch of the State Legislative Advocacy support program for 2021! 

What does that mean? 

We want to support the work of Indivisible groups on the ground! We know you are working hard to advocate for progressive legislation at the local level and we couldnâ€™t be more excited! Attend this webinar to learn about how you can get support to build advocacy campaigns, research legislation, as well as help talking about progressive legislation with your state and local representatives. We'll walk you through the supports we can offer, how to access those supports, and more.
