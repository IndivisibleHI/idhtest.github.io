**Background**

SB 964 passed the Senate in May. The Assembly Appropriations Committee is the last hurdle before it can be voted on in the Assembly. Opponents are lobbying this committee so support letters are important.
CALPERS (CA public employees) is the largest public pension plan in the country and CALSTRS (CA teachers) is the second largest. Together their portfolios are worth $560 billion giving them tremendous influence. More data is becoming available which makes it possible to link an individual fossil fuel company to its share  of climate change damage. Several law suits, including those of San Francisco, New York City and Boulder, have been filed against individual oil companies for damages from the climate change their products have caused. 
The fossil fuel companies not only need to worry about their legal liability, they are in danger of having to “strand” assets. As the transition from fossil fuels to alternative forms of energy speeds up the fossil fuel companies risk having to leave some of their assets in the ground whether they want to or not. Hence their reserves and stock prices are likely overvalued. The extent of overvaluation needs to be assessed to protect all future pensions.
