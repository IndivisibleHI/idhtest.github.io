call-script-text: "I live in(city and zip). I am very worried about the relationship
  between climate change and extreme weather, especially the recent increases in drought,
  and the increasingly damaging fires  wild fires in the State. I urge the Assembly
  Appropriations Committee to move SB964 out of committee to the Assembly floor so
  it can be voted on this August. \n\nRequiring CALPERS and CALSTRS to consider the
  climate-related financial risks of the investments in their portfolios, SB 964 would
  strengthen the portfolios and provide a model for other investment funds to assess
  their risks.  Further, because SB964 requires that CALPERS and CALSTRS publicly
  report on the climate-related financial risk of the companies in their portfolios,
  it will focus public attention on the economic damage fossil fuels are creating.
  This will highlight the importance of transitioning away from fossil fuels as fast
  as is feasible. "

**Background**

SB 964 passed the Senate in May. The Assembly Appropriations Committee is the last hurdle before it can be voted on in the Assembly. Opponents are lobbying this committee, so support letters are important.

CALPERS (CA public employees) is the largest public pension plan in the country, and CALSTRS (CA teachers) is the second largest. Together their portfolios are worth $560 billion, giving them tremendous influence. Data is becoming available which makes it possible to link an individual fossil fuel company to its share  of climate change damage. Several law suits, including those of San Francisco, New York City and Boulder, have been filed against individual oil companies for damages from the climate change their products have caused. 

The fossil fuel companies not only need to worry about their legal liability, they are in danger of having to “strand” assets. As the transition from fossil fuels to alternative forms of energy speeds up, the fossil fuel companies risk having to leave some of their assets in the ground, whether they want to or not. Hence their reserves and stock prices are likely overvalued. The extent of overvaluation needs to be assessed to protect all future pensions.
