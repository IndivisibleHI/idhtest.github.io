September 27, 2020
1346 days since Trump took office, [pick your worst nightmare of the Trump Administration].  Now imagine 1460 more days of the Trump Administration. 

37 days to go until the election day of our life time. READY to write to the voters in swing states to **Beat Trump** and **flip U.S. Senate blue**? 
Join us to learn how to use VoteFwd to write to Democrats in swing states to vote safely from home or vote early.   

You must **[RSVP/register](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMpduitqDIuHdJjlBStpMCErF3caun38F2U)** to get your unique link to the zoom meeting.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
