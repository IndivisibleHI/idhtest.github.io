call-script-text: 'Jim Bridenstine is a politician who is unqualified to lead NASA.
  Please oppose his nomination. NASA’s role in monitoring and researching climate
  change and weather patterns is too important to put into the hands of a leader with
  no science training and one who does not believe in human-caused climate change.  '

### Background
In an address to the House in 2013 Bridenstine stated the following: "Mr. Speaker, global temperatures stopped rising 10 years ago," he said. "Global temperature changes, when they exist, correlate with sun output and ocean cycles." Bridenstine does not have a technical background, having studied economics and psychology at Rice University in Houston, Texas, and receiving an MBA from Cornell University. He has shown little in the way of executive experience. NASA’s work on climate change and its network of satellites are  crucial to understanding global climate change. The Agency conducts global-level research on climate science, including solar activity, sea level rise, the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, the state of the ozone layer, air pollution, and changes in sea ice and land ice. NASA scientists regularly appear in the mainstream press as climate experts.
