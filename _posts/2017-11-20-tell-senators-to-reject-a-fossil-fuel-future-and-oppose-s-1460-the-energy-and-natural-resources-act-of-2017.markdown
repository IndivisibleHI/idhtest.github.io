title: Tell Senators to Reject a Fossil Fuel Future and Oppose S 1460, the Energy
  and Natural Resources Act of 2017.

  Hi, my name is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].

  I urge you to oppose S 1460, the Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017.  This bill would increase dependence on fossil fuels for decades.  It would expedite build-out of fossil fuel infrastructure, speed development of LNG terminals and lead to increased fracking.  I want to ensure a future without global warming for my children, and we cannot afford to give fossil fuels any advantage.  We should be creating jobs and a better future through renewable energy, yet this bill amazingly includes no provisions for solar or wind energy. Please vote no.

  Thank you for your time and attention.
