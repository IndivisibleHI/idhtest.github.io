**We’ve defeated Trump. We’ve defeated his cronies. We won in Georgia
and took the Senate. We’ve celebrated. Now, we have a short window to
save our democracy. Getting it done depends on all of us, and this new
Indivisible guide provides a blueprint.**

Together, we’ve defeated Trump. Now, it’s time for us to defeat the forces that
allowed him to rise and that continue to threaten our democracy.

We have this opportunity now because Democrats won a trifecta. We’ve been
in a similar place before. We were congressional staffers during the last
Democratic trifecta in 2009. We witnessed the rise of the Tea Party and the
GOP’s campaign to undermine President Obama. That experience inspired
the original Indivisible Guide. Now, as President-Elect Biden and the
Democrats return to power, we offer the flip side of that experience: what we
can learn from the last time Democrats held a trifecta.

**If there’s one takeaway from this new guide, we hope it’s this: we have the
power, we have the opportunity, it’s up to us, and the time is now.**
