Please join us at the Planned Parenthood office for a light meal and educational talk by Lawrence Basha on **Automatic Voter Registration** and how you can get involved. Be heard. **Learn how to write and submit testimony to the Hawaii State Legislature.** No charge. Bring a laptop or tablet if you can.

Find out how you can help pass this bill before our Legislature closes in April.

If you can't attend but want more info send an email to [IndWind808@gmail.com](mailto:IndWind808@gmail.com) and put "AVR" in the title.
