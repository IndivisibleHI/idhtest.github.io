We'll be canvassing with the Tracy Democratic Club "Go Team." Please sign up and enlist some friends, too! Email [canvassing captains](canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) to RSVP. It’s totally cool if you have never canvassed before. These are easy days, and the drive is less than 90 minutes. Joining in on these trips is a great way to get practice and familiarity with the work—and excitement—of going door-to-door to talk to real people. If you’re nervous and you want to learn more about what it’s like, feel free to get in touch with [our canvassing captains](mailto:canvassing+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) or [us](mailto:elections+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org) for more information.

**Note**: The times listed on this page are "door to door" times, i.e. the time from leaving Berkeley to returning back to Berkeley. They account for travel time to/from Tracy (90 minutes).
