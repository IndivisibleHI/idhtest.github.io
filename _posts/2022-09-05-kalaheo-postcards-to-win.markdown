Help be the change we want!  We will sit in a tropical garden setting under a canopy, protecting us from sun and wind while we write to ask democratic voters in swing states to insure they are registered and to vote Democrat! 

**When: Every Saturday through October, 10AM - NOON HST**

**Where: 3756 Papalina Road, Kalaheo**

We have refreshments and a lot of fun while we work to help save our democracy. We use ink stamps for decor and colored pens. itâ€™s fun while we write our message.
