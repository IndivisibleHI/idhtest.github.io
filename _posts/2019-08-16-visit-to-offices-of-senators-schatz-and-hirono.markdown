On the first Tuesday of every month, we visit the offices of Senators Schatz and Hirono at the Prince Kuhio Federal Building, 300 Ala Moana Blvd., Honolulu, HI 96850, from noon-1pm to discuss issues of mutual importance.

We meet outside the makai security entrance on Ala Moana and go first to Schatz's office (room 7-212) and then to Hirono's office (room 3-106).
