</p>
<p>Dear {{ FirstName | default: 'Indivisible Berkeley Community' }},
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We are not safe at school. Congress must take meaningful action.</em><br>
</p>
<p>In the wake of the Parkland tragedy, we don't need a script to remind us to listen to victims and we don't need ludicrous ideas about arming all teachers or even more "adept" ones &mdash; you know, the ones who can (or can't) sink a four foot putt. Here's a <strong>reality check</strong> on what we can do to curtail rampant gun violence now.

<h3>ACTIONS THIS WEEK
</h3>
<p><strong>Protect the Americans With Disabilities Act | </strong> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/620">House Resolution 620,</a> the misleadingly named “ADA Education and Reform Act,” passed the House on February 15. This cruel act would <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/hr-620-myths-and-truths-about-ada-education-and-reform-act">make it much harder</a> for people with disabilities to sue to remove barriers to access in public places, and would remove incentives to comply with the ADA. By shifting the responsibility of ADA compliance from businesses to people with disabilities, the bill would destroy a key element of the ADA. We can still fight it in the Senate. Action? Call your Senators to say: "I'm calling to urge the Senator to oppose HR 620, the ADA Education and Reform Act. Please don't place additional barriers in the path of people with disabilities!"

<p><strong><br>DACA Lives On</strong> <strong>|</strong> Now that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-daca-dreamers.html">Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal of the DACA ruling, </a>the Department of Homeland Security must continue to accept renewal applications from the roughly 700,000 young people who are currently enrolled in the program, known as DACA. The administration had intended to shut the program down by March 5, but that deadline is now largely meaningless. We need to <a href="https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/action/keep-fighting-for-dreamers-and-tps"><strong>keep fighting for Dreamers and TPS</strong></a> by making sure that Members of Congress get a DACA fix that is consistent with our values and that doesn’t require Dreamers to sacrifice their parents and other immigrants in the process.<br>
