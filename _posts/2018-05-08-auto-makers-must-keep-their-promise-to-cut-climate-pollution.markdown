call-script-text: "### Action  \nTell auto makers to withdraw pressure on EPA to weaken
  climate pollution standards for vehicles and to publicly state their support for
  the standards they previously agreed to. Messages may be sent to the Alliance for
  Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the makers of 70% of cars sold in the
  U.S. and has been lobbying to weaken the standards.  \n\n### Suggested Script to
  the Alliance\n(It’s best to personalize the script if possible.)  \n\nI am disappointed
  that the Alliance has worked to undo the promise auto makers made in 2012 to achieve
  strong standards to reduce climate pollution.  Since passenger vehicles account
  for 60% of transportation sector carbon emissions, and transportation contributes
  a third of U.S. climate pollution, U.S. automakers have an opportunity to be leaders
  in addressing climate change.  In California where I live, it is even more important
  to reduce emissions as transportation accounts for more than 36% of greenhouse gases.
  \ \n\nStrong, stable and achievable emissions standards benefit the auto industry
  at the same time they benefit the public and the planet.  EPA’s standards are reducing
  climate pollution, saving families money, and growing the jobs of the future.  Maintaining
  the standards agreed to in 2012 provides stability to auto makers, makes them competitive
  in the global market, and helps keep jobs in the U.S.  \n\nClimate change is real
  and is already affecting our lives. I want my next car to be made by a company that
  publicly supports the strongest fuel-efficiency and emission standards - a company
  that cares about the public's health and safety and is a leader in reducing its
  contribution to climate change.  \n\nPlease put the American people first, keep
  your promise, and reconsider your efforts to change the standards.  \n\n### Suggested
  Script for your Members of Congress\nI have sent the attached comments to the Alliance
  for Automobile Manufacturers.  I ask for your support to publicly denounce the planned
  rollback of climate-related vehicle emission standards and to use your authority
  to hold EPA accountable to the best science and the health and safety of the American
  people.  Thank you."

### Background  
Passenger vehicles emit 60 percent of transportation-related carbon pollution, and the transportation sector contributes a third of U.S. carbon pollution to the atmosphere. EPA’s greenhouse gas emission standards are the single biggest step the U.S. has taken to address climate pollution.  However, the EPA under Pruitt has announced that it will roll back automobile greenhouse gas emission limits and fuel efficiency standards that automakers agreed to in 2012.  Automakers are breaking their 2012 promise by pushing the Trump administration to weaken the standards adopted in 2012 for the years 2022-2025 (gradually stronger standards are implemented over time).  Health and technology-based standards have already reduced 230 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions and saved consumers more than $49B in gas costs while creating jobs - more than 288,000 are employed in the U.S. making parts for cleaner vehicles -  and reducing oil consumption, while automakers have enjoyed record-breaking sales. The 2022-2025 standards would reduce 6B tons of carbon pollution and $1.7T in gas costs.  

In a reversal of EPA’s mission and with pressure from the industry, Pruitt is trying to weaken vehicle emission standards. Weaker standards will harm the public’s health, worsen climate change, make vehicles more expensive to drive, reduce jobs and weaken global competitiveness.  Pruitt ignores comprehensive analysis by EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the California Air Resources Board showing that the standards are achievable at reasonable cost and that benefits outweigh overall costs.  

Note that some manufacturers have come out in support of EPA’s existing standards but are looking for more flexibility in applying them.  Other companies plan to make their entire fleets electric in the near future.
