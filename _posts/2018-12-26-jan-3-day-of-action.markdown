Democrats take over the House of Representatives on January 3, 2018. Let's show them we mean business! [Whose House? Our House!](https://indivisible.org/resource/hr-1-strengthening-our-democracy)

Join Indivisible Berkeley, Indivisible East Bay, Indivisible Euclid and others at a rally in Downtown Oakland for the National Day of Action. Our priority is supporting H.R. 1, a bill to protect and empower voters, fight the influence of money in politics, and strengthen federal ethics regulations (to make them apply to the President!)

**We will tell Rep. Lee to push for even more progressive additions to the bill!**

Join us also for a sign-making party on Sunday, December 30 (time and location TBA).
