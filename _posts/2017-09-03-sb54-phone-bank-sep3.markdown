Don't Let Trump Use California Police or Sheriffs for Mass Deportations!  Treat everyone fairly under California law!  

We'll be calling registered Democrats in Northern California target districts to ask them to call the Governor and their own Assemblymember to ask them to support a strong California Values Act (SB 54).

Bring a cell phone with earbuds for comfort.  (NO laptop needed.)
