We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** during the 2020 election.  

Congressional District 11 in North Carolina is one of the "3fer"s - 1.  Biden 2. Cal Cunningham for U.S. Senate and 3. Moe Davis for U.S. House. U.S. House seat became vacant when Mark Meadows (yeah that one) became Trump's new Chief of Staff.  Moe Davis is a retired Air Force Colonel with a progressive agenda.  Learn more about Moe at https://moedavisforcongress.com/.  

**Email natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org** by June 13th 10AM HST to get the zoom meeting information.
