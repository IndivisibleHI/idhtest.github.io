**Ten tons of plastics enter the oceans every minute**

### Action
To help reduce plastic waste that is endangering the oceans, wildlife and the safety of our food and water, learn ways to avoid using plastics at the [Berkeley Ecology Center’s events](https://ecologycenter.org/calendar/) this month.  

### Events
Events include information on plastic-free school, office  and personal supplies; how corporations, businesses, cities and countries are reducing plastics; the film, “Albatross;” a shoreline cleanup day; a tour of the Berkeley Recycling Yard; and how to contribute and receive discounts at the Ecology Center store.  For the full list and schedule of events, look for “Upcoming Events” on the [Ecology Center website](https://ecologycenter.org/).
