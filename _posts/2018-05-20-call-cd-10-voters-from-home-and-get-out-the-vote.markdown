Itâ€™s time to go all out to flip Congressional District 10!  CD-10 is ripe for the taking, but we need to get a LOT of Democrats to the polls in order to prevent the 2 Republican candidates from winning both slots on the November ballot.

You can help GET OUT THE VOTE for the June 5 primary by calling voters from your home!  Just attend one of our phone bank events over the next 2 weeks.  They're fun -- and we'll get you started and comfortable using the phone bank.  After that, we hope you'll consider making calls to voters from home.  Let's keep up this effort and win this District!
