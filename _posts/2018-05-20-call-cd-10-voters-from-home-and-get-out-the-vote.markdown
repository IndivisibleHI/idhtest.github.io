HOME STRETCH! Itâ€™s time to go all out to flip Congressional District 10!  CD-10 is ripe for the taking, but we need to get a LOT of Democrats to the polls in order to prevent the 2 Republican candidates from winning both slots on the November ballot.

You can help GET OUT THE VOTE for the June 5 primary by calling voters from your home!  Just attend one of our phone bank events to get started.  They're fun -- and we'll get you  comfortable using the phone bank.  After that, PLEASE help get Dems out to vote by phoning from home through the afternoon of Tuesday, June 5!  Let's keep up the effort and win this District!

Our last phone bank event before the primary will be on May 31; RSVP [here](https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/team/elections). Hope to see you there! Please bring: laptop or ipad/tablet, earbuds, chargers, and enthusiasm!
