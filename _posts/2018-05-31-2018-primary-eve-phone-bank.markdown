**Help us flip a congressional district and check Trump's agenda! LET'S GET OUT THE VOTE!**

Join us for a special phone bank on Election Eve, June 4, at the Finnish Hall downstairs cafe to make sure that everyone in CD-10—even the procrastinators—make it to the polls!

If you attend this phone bank, you'll also receive instructions on how to call voters *on Election Day* at any time convenient to you.

After we finish our calls for the evening (around 7), we will head across the street for dinner together at La Mission.

What you’ll need: an ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

*The Finnish Hall downstairs cafe is only accessible via a side door facing the parking lot, and is down a flight of stairs. This venue is not ADA accessible. Email info@indivisibleberkeley.org with questions.*

Here's some background on thee Primary Election:

We'll be calling voters in Congressional District 10 (Tracy/Modesto area) to make sure we get LOTS of Democrats to to vote in the primary election on Tuesday, June 5.  If Dems don't show up in force,  there's a chance there will just be two Republicans (and not one Dem) on the ballot in November!  CD-10 is ripe for the taking, with a Republican congressman in a district that voted by a large margin against Trump in 2016.
