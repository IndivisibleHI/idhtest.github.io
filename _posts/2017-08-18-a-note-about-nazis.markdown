Dear Berkeley community members,

At Indivisible Berkeley, our mission is to resist the Trump agenda and embody democratic and progressive values by engaging nonviolently with our political system. We are aware of plans for another White Supremacist and neo-Nazi "Free Speech" rally in Berkeley on August 27. We will update this post with more information on our plans for August 27 as it becomes available. To receive email updates from us, please [sign up here](https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/join.html).

We sent details of our event via an email blast with the subject "Empowering Berkeley for the Journey Ahead." Please check it out and join us today! If you have any questions, we suggest you reach out to your team leads, team mailing list, other IB friends/acquaintances or our Slack channels.

[Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin](https://www.jessearreguin.com/blog-1/2017/8/18/how-do-we-act-in-the-face-of-bigotry-bzl6p) and Representative Barbara Lee's office both recommend that we all stay away from the downtown area, including any counter-protests happening downtown. This is also in keeping with strong advice of the [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/20170814/ten-ways-fight-hate-community-response-guide#an%20alternative). For now, Indivisible Berkeley is making the same recommendation to our community members.

Stand Indivisible,

The Steering Team
