YOU can make it possible for more phone volunteers to help us win back our country --  and from the comfort of your own home! Indivisible Berkeley is working hard to support candidates in critical, must-win races that may determine whether Democrats can take back the US House and Senate as well as the battleground state of Michigan, which will be critical in the 2020 election.  We are gearing up, and need venues, ideally not too far from central Berkeley/Albany for volunteers  to do this important  campaign work!

WHAT DOES THIS INVOLVE?  Phone bank events usually draw 5-8 people working at a time.  People may sit at a table or chairs. You just need to provide a space like your living/dining room or kitchen table -- and have WIFI in your home.  If you like, you can provide some light snacks -- but we're also happy to do that!  You don't need to train people; our phone support person will be there.  And if you're crazy-busy and can't participate in the phoning, that's ok too!  Giving us a place to work is a huge contribution!

We hope to offer at least 2 Sunday afternoons a month. Please sign up for some dates-- and we'll get back to you soon with more details and answer  any questions you may have.
