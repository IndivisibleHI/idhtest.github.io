Why Michigan? Remember 2016?  Due to partisan gerrymandering, Republicans hold a drastically unfair advantage and are over-represented in the Michigan state legislature. It's critical for Democrats to win seats in 2018 to make blue inroads in this presidential battleground state. 

We're working with Sister District , which has identified this race as important and winnable.  We're supporting Mallory McMorrow for Michigan's State Senate to help stop Michigan's gerrymandering and voter rights' restrictions before we get to the 2020 census and presidential elections. Come and join us as we work to build her name recognition,  and identify likely voters and local Michigan volunteers for her campaign!
