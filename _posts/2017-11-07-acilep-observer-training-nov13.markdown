*Sponsored by the Berkeley Sanctuary City Task Force*

**Get trained to protect Alameda County from ICE!**

The Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership (ACILEP) invites you to join our team of volunteer responders to resist the raids and deportations!

Many folks who live and/or work in Alameda County are interested in supporting our undocumented community members and their families. A major need for our community is to have trained ICE responders that can be activated to show up and respond to ICE presence in Berkeley and throughout Alameda County, serve as legal observers, and support the family and community of the loved one being targeted by ICE action.

The more people we have trained by ACILEP, the more power we have as a sanctuary city to protect our community members from ICE raids.

At this training—taught by a team from ACILEP—you will:

  -  Learn how to verify ICE activity
  -  Learn how to be a legal observer in order to protect our communities from ICE
  -  Get Know Your Rights training in regards to interactions with law enforcement
  -  Practice role-playing scenarios so that you have practical experience to draw from
