Doors open at 7. We start promptly at 7:30.

Topic: Legislative progress, priorities and action options in the California Legislature, 2018-
2019

 - Increasing universality and affordability of health care coverage
 - Improving quality and equity of health care through accountability
 - Reducing health care prices.

Speaker: Yasmin Peled, Policy Advocate, Health Access (https://health-access.org/), Campaign
Communications Coordinator, Care4All California Campaign (http://care4allca.org/)

California is in position to lead the nation in Health Care reform in 2019-2020. Our large,
numerous, relatively healthy state led the nation in increasing the health insurance coverage
under ACA. Governor Newsom took bold Health Care policy actions on his first day in office.
Leaders in our Legislature are pushing the Governor to support bills that further increase
universality and affordability of Health Care coverage, improve quality and equity, and reduce
prices. Yasmin Peled will review California’s progress to date, introduce Care4All California’s
Legislative agenda for 2019, and outline possible future policy options in 2019-2020. Please
save the date.
