The Department of Homeland Security is taking public comments on their plan to expand surveillance of immigrants' social media activity. DHS is keeping paper and electronic "A-Files" on individual immigrants, including social media handles, "search results" and other identifiable information. Information could be collected on all immigrants, including green card holders and naturalized citizens, whether or not they are suspected of any wrongdoing.

Submit a comment to tell DHS you are opposed to this massive invasion of privacy for immigrants.

Comments must be submitted by October 18.
