call-script-text: "*Personalize this script if possible*\n*Note: It **is** best to
  include the references at the end*\n\nThe proposed Clean Water Act determination
  should NOT be withdrawn.  The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the
  health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in
  Alaska are far too great. Those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting
  streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential
  of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery.
  \ The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25
  federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for
  their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol
  Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it.
  The watershed’s unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits
  and employment.  EPA’s original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and
  thoroughly peer-reviewed.  That assessment and related public comments should strongly
  influence any future action.\n\nReferences:  \nU.S. EPA. An Assessment of Potential

### Background

*Via [SaveEPA](http://www.saveepaalums.info/resisting-the-trump-de-regulatory-agenda-talking-points/defending-bristol-bay/)*:  
In July 2014 EPA proposed to restrict dumping of mining wastes in the Bristol Bay watershed in Southwest Alaska to protect salmon fisheries. The pristine habitat in the watershed sustains one of world’s most important fisheries, including half of the global supply of wild sockeye salmon.
On July 19, 2017, The Trump Administration proposed to withdraw the July 2014 proposed determination.
