Join us at the Finnish Hall for our next General Assembly! Doors open at 7PM; we'll start promptly at 7:30PM.  We'll have updates from our teams, an invited speaker, and community event announcements, followed by team breakouts and discussions.

This GA will include a focus on women’s issues, in part to commemorate the First Inaugural Women's Convention in Detroit, which is being organized by the Women’s March planners. This week has also developed into #MeToo week, highlighting sexual harassment as a national issue.

### T-Shirt Distribution

T-Shirts will be available for purchase between 7 and 7:30 PM, immediately before the GA, for $25 cash or $26 credit card. We have sizes ranging from small to 2XL and these shirts run large. We apologize in advance if we run out of the size you want. T-shirts will also be available for sale at the following General Assembly, on November 5.

## Guest Speakers

Our guest speakers will from BHS Stop Harassing, Respect is Part of Research, and Equal Rights Advocates.



BHS Stop Harassing is a group of Berkeley High School students who are working to change the culture surrounding sexual harassment and violence at BHS and beyond. They want Berkeley High to be a model high school where all students feel safe and respected. They seek to spur district administrators and school decision-makers to immediately address shortcomings in the school environment that impede student success insofar as those factors create an unsafe learning environment.

Respect is Part of Research is a group of graduate students at Cal, based in the Physics Department, who organize peer training focused on preventing sexual harassment in academia.

Equal Rights Ascicates is a national civil rights organization dedicated to protecting and expanding economic and educational access for women and girls.
