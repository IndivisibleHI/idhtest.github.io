At our March 11 General Assembly, Indivisible Berkeley members wrote postcards to local officials supporting our local Sanctuary City policies. Our members want to make sure our Mayor, Jesse Arreguin, and Police Chief, Andrew Greenwood, know we support Berkeley's Sanctuary policy and will support them against threats from the Trump administration. We also thank Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf for her warning to immigrant communities of impending ICE raids.
