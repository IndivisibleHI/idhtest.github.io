Building the BigBlue Wave starting in Virginia.  At our first Postcards4va.com event, 15 volunteers generated over 200 postcards for Dan Helmer, Democrat running for House of Delegates in Fairfax.
Dan, a West Point Grad and veteran, FaceTimed us to thank us for support and emphasized his commitment to expand healthcare for all, protect everyone with preconditions and his support for a woman’s right to choose.  He strongly supports gun control. See the NYT’s article with a picture of Dan and discussing how gun control is a powerful issue for Democrats this year in Virginia. 

Join us Saturday, August 24 at noon at the Varsity building second floor to continue our postcarding.  
Check out postcards4va.com to see how easy it is for all of us to build the Blue Wave .
