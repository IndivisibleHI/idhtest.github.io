call-script-text: Hello, my name is (your name), and I'm a constituent from Berkeley.
  I'm calling to let Representative Lee know that since Trump is declaring a state
  of emergency over the border, I want her to vote No tonight on the conference committee
  bill. It is a reward for the president declaring a fake state of emergency. Instead,
  I want Representative Lee to vote for a clean "continuing resolution" that funds
  the government without increasing funding for ICE detentions of people in our community.
  Thank you for your time today. (You will be asked for your zip code.)

Trump has declared his intention to abuse his power by declaring a state of emergency on the border. It’s easy to forget how not-normal this is, but **no president has ever used emergency powers to rally his base and fulfill empty and xenophobic campaign slogans.**

At the same time, Congressional leaders have negotiated a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government. From Indivisible National: **“The bill includes an overall increase to DHS’s enforcement budget, $1.375 billion for Trump’s wall (although not his full demand for $5 billion), a massive increase in jail space for immigrants and asylum seekers, and funding for more ICE/CBP agents.”**

We think that Trump’s abuse of emergency powers should NOT be rewarded with more money for his racist policies. Please call Barbara Lee’s office NOW and ask her for a clean CR, without border funding, if Trump insists on declaring a fake state of emergency.
