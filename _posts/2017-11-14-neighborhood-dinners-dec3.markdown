Join 5-10 of your neighbors at one of our neighborhood dinners, hosted by and for IB members on Sunday, December 3. We have hosts in almost every Berkeley zip code, so there's sure to be a dinner near you!

RSVPs coming soon, but for now, here is our (still-growing) host list. Save the date!

- Linda, 94702
- Brandon, 94704
- James, 94704
- Julia, 94706
- Ruth, 94706
- Don and Madelyn, 94707
- Diane, 94707
- Anna, 94708

After the meal, you'll have a chance to plan out how you'd like to contribute to the progressive wave for the 2018 midterm elections on November 6, 2018. Plus, no IB party would be complete without some postcards---this time for **Doug Jones, the only non-pedophile running for Senate in Alabama**. The election is on December 12, so we'll be helping with the final Get Out The Vote effort!
