This is our regular textbanking effort with live support at Drake's Dealership in Oakland with Sister District Project CA-13 and Indivisible East Bay. 

Textbanking can be done alone, furious and often done on the fly, but it's more fun and focused in groups where you can grab a beer or a snack, chat with other activists and get unstuck because experienced textbankers will be with you to pull you out of holes. We guarantee there will always be opportunities for you waiting in the queue! Work flows should be available two days before the textbank and weâ€™ll help you get started before you arrive. 

For more information, contact IB Textbanking Captain Steve Cohen at cohensteve@att.net.
