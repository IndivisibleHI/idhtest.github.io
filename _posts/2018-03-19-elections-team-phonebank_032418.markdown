How do we take back Congress and help put the brakes on Trump’s agenda?  By starting NOW! Help us by calling fellow Indivisible Berkeley members to invite them to come canvassing with us! You’ll be phoning alongside sympatico folks too! If you haven't gone canvassing yourself, you can still call!  Our phone bank hosts have done this and can help you answer questions.

What you’ll need: an ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone, with earbuds.
