This is our regular team meeting and will be a pizza and postcard gathering tonight! No need to bring postcards or stampsâ€”we have those covered. Just bring yourself, a friend, and (if you can) a few dollars to help cover the cost of food and space. 

[More info and RSVP here!](https://www.facebook.com/events/154217488502370/?acontext=%7B&link_id=8&can_id=d2233b711e42e19a5c6e98d44879118f&source=email-newsletter-go-skinner-stop-trumpcare&email_referrer=email_238765&email_subject=newsletter-go-skinner-stop-trumpcare)

Doors at 7pm for set up and socializing; meeting begins at 7:30pm.

The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

Come join us! New folks are very welcome.
