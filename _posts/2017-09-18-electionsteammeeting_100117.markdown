Come join the Elections Team for a laid back evening where we work on some postcards encouraging Democrats to vote. And eat some pizza! Sound OK?? 
We'll have the postcards, stamps and pens. Just bring yourself, a clipboard if you have one, and a few dollars to help us cover food and supplies. Salads and beverages also welcome additions to the gathering.
