### Action
Call your Congressman and Senators on June 5, 2019 to let them know you support the [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR 763)](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/action/tell-representatives-to-support-the-national-carbon-pricing-bill). This bill would tax carbon emissions and refund the revenue to all households. Its border adjustment provision ensures that the US would remain competitive with other countries. Make it clear that adopting solutions to climate change is a high priority for you.  

The June 5 Call Congress Day is a national effort to get a strong show of support for this bill as a precursor to Citizens’ Climate Lobby’s June 11 Lobby Day the following week in Washington DC. Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) has been promoting a Carbon Fee and Dividend bill similar to HR 763 for years. They will also be seeking more cosponsors for the bill.

### Suggested Comment
*Hi, my name is (name) and I’m a constituent from (city and zip code).*  

*I’m calling because climate change is a major concern of mine. I am strongly in favor of HR 763 (the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act) and consider it to be a top priority. We are already suffering from the effects of climate change and can not afford to delay easy to implement legislation that would reduce carbon emissions effectively at a pace at least as fast as that agreed to in the Paris Climate Accord. This is a very important issue to me because….*  

(1) If your House Representative is already a cosponsor of HR763 (noted in above contact list) be sure to thank him or her for cosponsoring this bill and ask them to try to find more cosponsors.  
 
(2) If your House Representative is not yet a cosponsor please ask him to become one.  

(3) For our Senators let them know that you want S3791 (Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2018) to be reintroduced this year and that you would like them to cosponsor it. This bill has Republican support as well as Democratic support. It would help attain the Democratic goals of the Green New Deal while also minimizing the role of government, a Republican goal.  

*Thank you for your time and attention.*

### Background
For more information on the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act check out our recent action supporting it: "[Tell Representatives to Support the National Carbon Pricing Bill.](https://indivisibleberkeley.org/action/tell-representatives-to-support-the-national-carbon-pricing-bill)”  

Citizen’s Climate Lobby has chapters throughout the country which educate MOCs and the public about climate change and the need for a national carbon tax that would return all proceeds to the public. This solution is effective because it is both efficient and equitable.  They are bipartisan with support among both progressives and conservatives as well as economists. HR 763 embodies their approach. For more information visit CCL’s website [https://citizensclimatelobby.org/](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/).  

Knowing that the carbon fee would increase annually would provide a tremendous incentive for everyone to find substitutes for fossil fuels. Monthly dividends would protect lower and middle income families from the price changes that would result from carbon fees.  

The border adjustment clause would not only protect American producers it would also encourage other countries to adopt carbon taxes.  

The California Assembly and Senate recently adopted Joint Resolution #43 which urges the US Congress to enact a revenue neutral tax on fossil fuels with all revenue returned to households and a border adjustment tax to maintain national competitiveness. It further calls for this carbon tax to increase steadily over several years. HR 763 incorporates all these suggestions. The cities of Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond and El Cerrito and Alameda County have adopted similar resolutions.
