**Trump and Mitch McConnell refuse to let their hostages go.** Trump and McConnell are losing. Out of desperation, McConnell is planning to bring two bills to the floor for a vote this week. The first is an extreme bill that reads like Stephen Miller’s wish list.

**The second vote is on a clean continuing resolution** that would fund the government until Feb. 8. If it passes, it would mean that federal employees would finally get paid, affected programs would be funded, and our government would open back up.

It’s important that we first block Trump’s anti-immigrant bill, and then put pressure on Republicans to do the right thing and open up the government by passing a clean CR. 

[Read more about the shutdown here](https://indivisible.org/resource/trump%E2%80%99s-latest-temper-tantrum-and-showdown-over-wall). Tell our Senators to Vote NO on Trump's racist, anti-immigrant bill and vote YES on a clean CR. Then, check in with Representative Barbara Lee to make sure she knows you don't want her to cave on a clean CR.

### Once you've called, hop over to the [national phone bank](https://act.indivisible.org/signup/end-trumpshutdown/) TODAY!
You'll be calling Democrats with Republican Senators, asking them to tell their Senators to vote for the clean CR.
