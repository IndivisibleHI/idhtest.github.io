We recommend eating a proper dinner before you head over for this gathering, as we’re having an ICE CREAM SOCIAL. We’ll also do a quick review of recent events (like the primary in CA-10, and our first trip to Reno), and offer pop-up trainings for some voter contact methods, like phonebanking, so feel free to bring your phone and laptop if you’d like some help getting started or have questions. 

The Elections Team focuses on flipping red districts through voter contact. We canvass, phonebank, write postcards, and register new voters. We work with and support local partners.

We also work on electoral reform issues.

Come hang out with us at our monthly meeting!
