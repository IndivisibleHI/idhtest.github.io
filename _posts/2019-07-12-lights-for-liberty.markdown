Outraged by the violence being perpetrated by the U.S. government against people fleeing persecution, a group of mothers and volunteers dedicated to human rights came together to form Lights for Liberty: A Vigil to End Human Concentration Camps.

Thanks to their efforts, there are more than 500 events planned to protest the inhumane conditions faced by migrants, many of them children. Participants will gather on Friday, July 12 at detention centers, in parks, outside local government offices, and at faith centers â€” both in the U.S and globally.

**Public Event: Hosted by South Maui District 11 Representative Tina Wildberger**
