Building the BigBlue Wave starting in Virginia.  At most recent  Postcards4va.com event, over 20 volunteers generated over 500 postcards for Dan Helmer, Democrat running for House of Delegates in Fairfax.

Dan, a West Point Grad and veteran, FaceTimed us to thank us for support and emphasized his commitment to expand healthcare for all, protect everyone with preconditions and his support for a woman’s right to choose.  He strongly supports gun control. See the NYT’s article with a picture of Dan and discussing how gun control is a powerful issue for Democrats this year in Virginia.

Join us Saturday, September 7 at noon at the Varsity building second floor to continue our postcarding.
