Building the BigBlue Wave starting in Virginia.  At most recent  Postcards4va.com event, over 20 volunteers generated over an additional 500 postcards for Dan Helmer, Democrat running for House of Delegates in Fairfax.

Dan, a West Point Grad and veteran, FaceTimed us to thank us for support and emphasized his commitment to expand healthcare for all, protect everyone with preconditions and his support for a woman’s right to choose.  He strongly supports gun control. See the NYT’s article with a picture of Dan and discussing how gun control is a powerful issue for Democrats this year in Virginia.

 Lots of free parking.  To access the 2nd floor of the Varsity Building, call the number posted at the elevator.
