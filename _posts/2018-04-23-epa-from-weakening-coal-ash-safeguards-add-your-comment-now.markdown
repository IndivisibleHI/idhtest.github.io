call-script-text: "*Note: It’s best to add to or modify the script below to personalize,
  if possible or add details from the talking points in SaveEPA’s excellent guide,
  [Defending Health and Environmental Safeguards for Coal Ash Disposal](http://saveepaalums.info/coalash1),
  or the [joint Environmental Integrity Project/Sierra Club/Earth Justice guide](http://www.environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CCR-rollback-TPs.pdf).*\n\nCoal
  ash is an extremely toxic waste that presents serious risks to human health and
  the environment. It is known to have high levels of mercury, arsenic, lead and many
  other contaminants that contribute to cancer, asthma, heart disease, birth defects
  and neurological and brain damage.  Children - 1.5M of whom live near coal ash sites
  - are especially vulnerable.  Coal ash is responsible for the largest toxic waste
  disaster in U.S. history - 1.2B tons - in Kingston, Tennessee in 2008.  EPA’s own
  data show the widespread contamination of air, groundwater and surface water - including
  drinking water - resulting from the 1100 unlined and inadequately protected coal
  ash waste disposal sites in the U.S.  Leaks, air pollution and discharges from poorly
  regulated coal ash disposal disproportionately affect the most vulnerable disadvantaged
  communities and children.  \n\nEPA’s proposed revision would harm citizens in order
  to reduce modest responsibility for utilities.  It would do away with the most protective
  aspects of the rule by, for example,  allowing states, and even the utilities and
  impoundment operators, to set their own standards - which need not be health-based
  - and to decide when cleanup of a release is necessary.  This is an unacceptable
  dereliction of EPA’s responsibilities.  Every community deserves equal protection
  based on the best science, and EPA enforcement is the backbone of providing that
  protection.  Furthermore, communities deserve to know whether they are safe, so
  the existing rule’s requirement to publicly post compliance data should not be altered.
  \ Nor should the safer siting and management rules established in 2015 rule be changed.
  \ \n\nEPA cites the savings to utility companies in its rationale for the proposed
  changes. However, when determining the overall costs and benefits of this proposed
  rulemaking, EPA must also take into account the costs of lost lives, workdays and
  property due to coal ash releases and contaminated drinking water; medical care
  for those affected by contamination; and environmental cleanup costs in the same
  way all of these costs were evaluated under the original proposal.  \n\nThere is
  no basis in science or in cost/benefit analysis that justifies reducing the protections
  established under EPA’s 2015 rule.  EPA should not weaken those safeguards but maintain
  the rule in its current form.  The 2015 rule protects our citizens (especially vulnerable
  children) and our environment, and was supported by over half a million public comments."

### Action
Tell EPA NOT to roll back EPA’s 2015 coal ash safeguards. [Click here]( https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0286-0001) or on the "Comment Now" link on this page to add your comment.

### Background
Coal ash (or coal combustion residuals (CCR)) is one of the largest categories of industrial waste in the United States.  Created when coal is burned by utilities to produce electricity, coal ash includes mercury, arsenic and other hazardous contaminants.  According to the EPA, 470 power plants generated about 110 million tons of coal ash in 2012.  When not managed properly, the storage and disposal areas for coal ash can pose serious environmental and health risks.  People living near coal ash disposal sites face contaminated drinking water, toxic dust in the air, and serious health threats, with children at particular risk for birth defects, asthma and cancer. An EPA study found that living within a mile of a coal ash disposal site had health effects equivalent to smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.  

Coal ash is typically disposed of in unlined pits, often next to lakes and rivers.  Hundreds of aging earthen dams hold back billions of tons of the toxic waste.  As of 2014, there have been 208 known cases of coal-ash spills and contamination. A 2008 spill in Tennessee and another spill in 2014 in North Carolina had devastating impacts on watersheds, nearby homes, and public health.  

In 2015, the EPA issued regulations to reduce the risks of coal ash disposal by requiring monitoring and corrective action for leaks into the groundwater and air and setting restrictions for where coal ash disposal areas could be located and how they should be designed and managed.  The rule also set out recordkeeping and reporting requirements. In 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act, which provided enforcement authority to the states and federal government over these facilities.  

In response to requests from the utility industry, the Trump Administration is proposing the first of two rules that would greatly weaken several provisions of the 2015 coal ash rule.  The proposed rule would allow states to set less strict groundwater standards for certain contaminants rather than cleaning up to background levels.  States would also be able to determine that remediation of spills and leaks would not be necessary in certain circumstances.  Groundwater monitoring could be modified and suspended if a demonstration could be made that there is no migration of pollutants.  The rule would also allow states to reduce the time currently required to monitor corrective actions and post-closure of sites.
