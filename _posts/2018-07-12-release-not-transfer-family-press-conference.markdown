In light of the recent announcement that ICE detainees will no longer be held in the West County Detention Facility, join the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity for a press conference outside the detention facility to support the families and current detainees. Come hear the relatives of the detainees as they voice their concerns with this closure and hopes for their loved onesâ€™ release. Among those demands are:
1. That the detainees not be transferred out of state which makes it nearly impossible for their loved ones to visit them and see them, as well as for their legal representation to continue to work on their cases. Also for the return of those who have already been transferred out of state.
2. That ICE use their discretion and release them on bond, so that at least they can be with their families and loved ones. 

Please come out and join us in supporting these families as we ask that their loved ones be released as soon as possible. The current actions result in the cruel separation of families and we strongly ask to please consider alternative options to detention so that families can be reunited. 


Note: As an alternative to parking at the detention center, you can park at the Point Pinole Regional Shoreline/Bay Trail parking lot at 5551 Giant Highway, and walk 0.4 miles (turn left) to the detention facility.
