call-script-text: "### Comment script  \n*Note: It is best to personalize the script
  by, for example, saying: 1) Why the issue is important to you; 2) How the issue
  might affect you or your family; 3) Using additional information included in [SaveEPA’s
  website](http://saveepaalums.info/NPDES+for+Groundwater).*  \n\nI am very concerned
  that the EPA is considering changing its approach to protecting surface water bodies
  under the Clean Water Act (CWA). EPA’s notice suggests that it may no longer regulate
  wastewater discharges that go directly into groundwater, even if that groundwater
  has a direct connection to a surface water body. The science is clear that connections
  exist between groundwater and surface water bodies in many cases. EPA’s application
  of the CWA to these types of discharges has been upheld in most court decisions.
  It is entirely consistent with the intent of the CWA that federal regulatory protections
  be used to protect surface water. The potential concern that EPA may be duplicating
  the states’ role in regulating groundwater is not correct. The CWA’s purpose in
  these cases is to regulate a discharge because it will reach surface water. Surface
  water, and not groundwater, is the object of EPA’s protection and authority. Groundwater
  serves simply as a conveyance from the discharge to the surface water body.  \n\nIn
  addition, federal regulation provides a standard of protection across all states
  in order to ensure consistent compliance and to safeguard freely flowing water.
  If EPA changed its interpretation and approach to regulating these discharges, it
  would mean that facilities could discharge waste water directly to groundwater and
  impact the quality of downstream water bodies used for recreation, drinking water,
  fishing, irrigation and other purposes.  \n\nEPA should not change its approach
  to regulating these discharges. If EPA does intend to make changes it must publish
  and request comment on the specific statements or documents it plans to revise and
  state the scientific and legal rationale for any changes.  \n\n### Script for Members
  of Congress \nI have sent the attached comments to the EPA regarding its notice
  on changing EPA’s approach to regulating discharges under the Clean Water Act, Docket#
  [EPA-HQ-OW-2018-0063](https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=EPA-HQ-OW-2018-0063).
  \ I ask for your support to publicly denounce plans to weaken EPA’s application
  of CWA protections and to use your authority to hold EPA accountable to the best
  science and the health and safety of the American people. Thank you."

### Background  
The Clean Water Act (CWA) is implemented by the EPA. It protects surface water bodies such as lakes, streams, rivers and oceans. Water from these areas can be used for swimming, fishing, agricultural irrigation and drinking water. The CWA requires a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for the discharge of pollutants from facilities such as industrial plants, sewage treatment plants and other types of facilities. These permits set acceptable discharge limits, conditions of discharge, and monitoring requirements. EPA has applied these requirements to waste water discharges that reach surface waters via groundwater or other subsurface flow that has a direct hydrologic connection to the surface waters. Most court cases have upheld that approach.  

The Trump EPA is requesting comments on revising EPA’s policies on the matter. EPA’s notice requesting comments asks for input on whether regulating these discharges is consistent with the purpose of the CWA; it asks indirectly whether EPA is improperly taking on regulation of groundwater, which is a state responsibility; and it asks whether other federal or state authorities should be used, instead, to regulate these discharges. This may be just the initial step in a larger Trump administration goal to weaken its application of the CWA.  

EPA’s notice for comment is not properly specific about the legal and scientific reasons for considering changes or which policies or documents it considering changing. The CWA is a powerful statute for keeping America’s waters safe, and any changes in applying it must be scientifically and legally responsible.
