Ella Baker Center (EBC) Prison Mail Night & “All Eyes On the Sheriff” Update at the Ella Baker Center Office 1970 Broadway, Suite 1125, in Oakland.  

EBC will host a mail night at their office to respond to the increasing amount of correspondence we've been receiving from people in prisons and jails across the country. We are getting lots of questions about prior ballot initiatives including Prop 47 and 57, advocacy support, requests for pen pals.  

Please RSVP to emily@ellabakercenter.org.
