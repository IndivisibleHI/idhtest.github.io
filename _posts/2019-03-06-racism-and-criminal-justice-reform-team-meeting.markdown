After voting to adopt many of the suggestions of the Ad Hoc Committee to reform Urban Shield, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors has directed the Committee to meet with representatives of The Alameda County Sheriffs Dept., BAUASI and County Counsel in order to ensure the new proposals meet UASI guidelines.
The Sheriff's Department is pushing back very strongly against any change to Urban Shield and is very likely to argue that any modification will constitute a breach of the contract. It is very important that we continue to make a strong show of support for the change we wish to see.
