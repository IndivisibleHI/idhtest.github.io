**[We Won, What's Next? Indivisible’s 2021 Strategy Session\
](https://act.indivisible.org/go/535059?t=17&akid=70328%2E331331%2Ei6h_4o)**\
We did it! We beat Trump and his cronies, kept The People’s House, and took back the United States Senate! This is an important moment to come together as a movement, celebrate our accomplishments, and look forward together to the future. The work must continue. Join us for this half-day strategy session, where we will discuss our plans to reform the American democracy as we head into a Democratic trifecta!

You’ll have a chance to connect with other Indivisible group leaders, groups members, and activists from across the country. When Indivisibles in rural and urban areas can lean on others and work together, we are stronger than ever. We are so excited to see you on January 31st!
