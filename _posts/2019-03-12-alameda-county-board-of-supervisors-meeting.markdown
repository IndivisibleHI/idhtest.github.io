The Board will hear a report on the results of the meeting between the Ad Hoc Committee on Urban Shield, The Alameda County Sheriff's office, County Counsel and BAUASI as to which of the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendations can be adopted without jeopardizing UASI funding. The results of this report will determine how deep the changes to Urban Shield will go.
