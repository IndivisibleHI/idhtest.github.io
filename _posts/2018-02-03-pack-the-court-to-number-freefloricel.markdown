Floricel's case will be heard before a federal district court judge on Tuesday February 6th! Last month, immigration Judge Burch denied Floricel's bond on the basis of her history with DUIs without taking into account the fact that well before her arrest by ICE, she was positively progressing in her rehabilitation and building a good life for her and her children. Now Floricel's case will go before a federal district court judge in an attempt to free Floricel in higher court. Join us as we stand in solidarity with Floricel and demand the courts to #FreeFloricel!

Rally: 12:30pm
Enter Federal Building: 1:15pm
Hearing Time: 2pm
