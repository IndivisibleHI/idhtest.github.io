A week and a half ago 8 of us attended Chief Greenwoods Community meeting.  Our presence at those meetings, asking questions or just taking it in, are a good thing. This coming Thursday is another.

The first hour and a half or so is Q and A with the Chief and then people are encouraged to meet with the various Police Dept. staff which attends the meetings.  You can talk to Parking enforcement or the SWAT team - and anyone in between.
