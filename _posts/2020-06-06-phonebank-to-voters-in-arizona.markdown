We need 28 additional electoral votes and 4 additional U.S. Senate seats to **Beat Trump and flip U.S. Congress blue** this November. Arizona went to Trump in 2016 but could go to Biden this year.  The U.S. Senate seat in Arizona is also flippable.  

Join Environmental Voter Project to call environmental voters in Arizona to inform and encourage them to sign up for the permanent early voting list in their state so they can vote by mail, safely from home.  

The phonebanking will be done using the Hubdialer software platform which means you don't need to use your phone.  The training will be conducted by the EVP staff as a virtual meeting using zoom. **You must RSVP** to get zoom meeting information.

When we Vote, We Win. When we write, We Vote. When we Text, We Vote. When we Call, We Vote.
