  My name is ________, and I am calling to ask Governor Brown to sign SB29 (the Dignity not Detention Act) and SB 54 (the California Values Act). We cannot use California's resources to help the Trump administration deport our community members. Can I count on the Governor to sign SB 29 and SB 54?

**UPDATE: Governor Brown signed SB 54 and SB 29 on October 5! Read the Governor's signing message [here](https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_54_Signing_Message_2017.pdf).**

Governor Brown has two important bills on his desk, awaiting his signature:
* SB 54, the California Values Act, would protect immigrants who haven't been convicted of a serious crime from being turned over to ICE by local law enforcement. It would also limit the ability of ICE to access sensitive places like schools, hospitals, and courthouses without a warrant. 
* SB 29, the Dignity Without Detention Act, would stop the spread of for-profit immigration detention centers in California.

Please call Governor Brown's office and ask him to sign both of these bills. They are both important steps California can take to protect our community members from deportation. The Immigration Team worked hard this summer to get SB 54 passed. Let's get both of these bills across the finish line!
