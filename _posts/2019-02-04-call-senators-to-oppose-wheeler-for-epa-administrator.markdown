call-script-text: "Hi, my name is [NAME] and I’m a constituent from [CITY, ZIP].  \n\nPlease
  oppose Andrew Wheeler’s nomination to lead the EPA.  His past as a coal lobbyist
  and senior aide to Senator Inhofe -  a climate denier and strong critic of EPA -
  \ makes him unfit for the post.  More importantly, he has already shown his disrespect
  for science, EPA’s mission and the public by continuing the administration’s efforts
  weaken environmental and public health safeguards in order to protect industry at
  the expense of Americans.  We need an EPA administrator who will put facts, science
  and the public first.  \n\nThank you for your time and attention.  \n\n[If leaving
  a voicemail, leave your full street address to ensure your call is tallied]"

### Action
Contact your senators to oppose Andrew Wheeler’s nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works is expected to vote on his nomination this week, which will then be followed by a floor vote.

### Background
Andrew Wheeler has been a lobbyist for the giant Murray Energy coal company, which has opposed every effort by EPA to regulate coal plant emissions and toxic coal ash.  He served as a senior aide to Senator Inhofe, a climate denier and strong critic of EPA.  Wheeler is continuing his predecessor, Scott Pruitt’s, efforts roll back environmental and public health protections gained during the Obama administration.  Wheeler’s interests and experiences lie, not in science-driven protections for the public, but in promoting the interests of powerful industries.
