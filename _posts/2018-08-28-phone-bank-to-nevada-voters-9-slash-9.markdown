Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate -- Think Supreme Court! We’ll also be supporting the Nevada State Democrats' coordinated campaign for Jacky as well as strong candidates for the House and for state offices.

WHAT YOU’ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
