Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate -- Think Supreme Court! We’ll also be supporting the Nevada State Democratic Party’s coordinated campaign for Jacky as well as strong candidates for the House and for state offices.

WHAT YOU’ll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
