This week, we want to make sure our Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris hear from Indivisible Berkeley **every single hour** so they know how much we hate the #TrumpTaxScam. If you'd like to contribute to this effort, read the training instructions below and **sign up for a time slot [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0avg6XWbuK1l5Tkm1kgoMycGSrvetoQhWTO61818a4/edit?usp=sharing)**.

### Training

This call would substitute for one of your daily calls to Senator Feinstein and Senator Harris.

1. Sign up for **exactly one** date and time to call the office of our Senators. **Please call only the SF offices**, so that the same office hears from everyone! If the line is busy, try calling back in 10 minutes. We want them to hear from as many different people as possible, so no repeats!

2. Use the script to influence our Senators.

     - Please follow the first paragraph of the script exactly, and the rest as close as you can. We’re looking for uniformity of message here.

     - On this call, **you are representing Indivisible Berkeley to our elected officials**. So please be firm but polite! Remember, they’re on our side for this fight—they need us to back them up.

3. Witness the power of our community! We’re calling Senate offices EVERY HOUR to have our voices heard!
