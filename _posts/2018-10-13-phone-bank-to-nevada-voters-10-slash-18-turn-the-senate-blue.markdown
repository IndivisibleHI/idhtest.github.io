Nevada is the only state in the midterm elections that has an incumbent Republican Senator in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. We can flip this state. Phone Nevada voters and help them send Democrat Jacky Rosen to the Senate. Think Supreme Court! We’ll be supporting the Nevada State Democrats’ coordinated campaign for Jacky as well as strong candidates for the House and for state offices.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop AND your cell phone with earbuds. If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

RSVP soon!

Any email updates from us will have “Indivisible Berkeley” in the subject line.
