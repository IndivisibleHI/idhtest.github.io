*Update: All the dinners on Sunday are full! Check out [Saturday's dinners here] (https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/event/neighborhood-dinners-2018-02-03) (sign up fast because they're almost full as well)*

Join 5-10 of your neighbors at one of our neighborhood dinners, hosted by and for IB members on Sunday, February 4. Between [Saturday](https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/event/neighborhood-dinners-2018-02-03) and Sunday, we have hosts in almost every Berkeley zip code, so there's sure to be a dinner near you!

At the meal, you'll have a chance to plan out how you'd like to contribute to the progressive wave for the 2018 midterm elections on November 6, 2018. Plus, no IB party would be complete without some postcards---this time for **Conor Lamb for US Congress (PA-18)**. The election is on March 13 and we are helping to build energy and excitement around his campaign.

[Edit: it looks like Tony the Democrat is all out of addresses for Margaret Good for Florida State House. This is a good problem to have!]
