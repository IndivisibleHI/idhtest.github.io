“Yes we can” Because “Yes we Did.”

In 2018 and 2020, we Won. We will win the Midterms by focusing on 15 million people who voted for the First time in 2018 and 2020 and 8 million new voters.

Text banking is fast and effective, with a response rate of 10-15%. You can send initial texts out to 5000+ in two hours.
