  \ Along with 69% of all Californians and most of the American people, I oppose opening
  our coastline to new oil and gas leases.  New leases would harm one of the world’s
  richest marine environments that supports a thriving fishing, recreation and tourist
  economy.  It would harm coastal cities in the path of inevitable spills.  And it
  would increase loss of life, injury, cardio-pulmonary illness, and healthcare costs
  due to air and CO2 pollution and the increasing frequency of major disasters and
  sea-level rise caused by climate change.    \n\nA decision to open the coast for
  offshore exploration does not reflect economic realities and would harm the existing
  robust coastal economy.  California’s economy is ranked 6th in the world.  The coastal
  economy, alone, provides more than 400,000 jobs and contributes $20 billion to the
  GDP through tourism, recreation and fishing, far outweighing any jobs or economic
  gains new drilling could provide.  Clean energy jobs outweigh all fossil fuel jobs
  in California by 6 to 1. The coastal economy would be harmed by construction of
  oil and gas platforms, pipelines and conveyances, the sonic disturbances of exploration
  (harming marine life), oil spills and climate-caused disasters. Even if all of the
  resources off California were exploited, the oil would last for less than 2 years
  at current consumption rates. Consumption is declining with increasing clean energy
  development. Americans do not need this oil and gas. \n\nOil spills are inevitable
  - and routine - with an average of 1000 reported per year according to Coast Guard
  records. Spills, disasters, injuries and death are even more of a risk now that
  the administration has proposed withdrawing the protections established after the
  Gulf of Mexico BP oil spill.  In the four years following the BP oil disaster, the
  federal government reported that offshore drilling accounted for 1,063 injuries,
  477 fires and explosions,11 spills of over 2100 gals and 11 fatalities. There is
  no economic, national security or public health reason to open the coasts to drilling.
  \ Rather, the data and science show that doing so will harm California’s and the
  nation’s economy, security and health.  (References below.)\n\n\n### References:

## Action
Comment to the Department of Interior’s Bureau of Energy Management to oppose plans to open the coasts to off-shore oil and gas drilling. (Click here)[https://www.regulations.gov/comment?D=BOEM-2017-0074-0001] or on the "Comment Now" link on this page to add your comment.

## Background
The federal Bureau of Energy Management (within the Department of Interior [DOI]) has proposed plans to make more than 98 percent of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) resources, including permanently protected areas, available to consider for oil and gas leasing during the five-year period beginning in 2019. Under the plan, nearly the entire OCS would be available for potential oil and gas discovery,  including the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans.  According to the Natural Resources Defense Council this action is part of the most sweeping industrial assault in history on our oceans, marine life, coasts and all they support.  It would put every American coastal city at risk of another BP oil-spill type disaster.    


There is no energy security need for this action - only industry profits.  According to the NRDC, the US produces 12.9 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids daily, yet exports 6.2 million barrels of crude and refined products.  The US now produces more oil than any time since the 1970’s (NRDC).  This occurs at a time when the effects of climate change - including ocean warming, acidification and sea-level rise - dictate that we should reduce our reliance on these fossil fuels.  


Oil and gas production at sea puts oceans, sea life and coastal areas at risk of blowouts, explosions, disastrous spills, and the sonic blasts used in exploration that can be dangerous, even lethal, to whales and other marine life. Expansion would threaten the critical marine breeding areas off the coast of California. The effects of climate change are already wreaking havoc on shellfish, coral reefs, and other foundational forms of life at sea.
