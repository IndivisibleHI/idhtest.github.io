All over Berkeley Sunday night, IBers gathered, dined together and wrote postcards to Alabama. Altogether we had over 80 guests coming together to form a stronger community, and we wrote almost 500 postcards for [#DougJonesAL](https://dougjones.com/). After a very hard week, this was just what we needed.

The next neighborhood dinner night will be in February or March.

In the meantime, here are some new memories from our 80+ guests spread out over 9 dinners! If you have more to share, tag us in them on Facebook or [leave us a comment on our post](https://www.facebook.com/BerkeleyIndivisible/posts/1632160056827573).
