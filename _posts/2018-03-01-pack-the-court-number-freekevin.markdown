About Kevin: Kevin has lived in the United States since the age of 1 and knows no other country than the United States. Kevin has DACA. He was a stellar student who achieved high marks in his classes and remains a committed member of his church where he participated in its youth choir. Kevin is beloved by his religious community and is missed greatly by his younger siblings.\
\
Despite Kevin’s DACA being valid through November 27, 2018, ICE decided to arrest him and his father in Redding, California under false pretenses. ICE unlawfully pretended to be local police, searched his father’s cell phone without a warrant, and called Kevin on his phone telling him they were “highway patrol” and that he needed to pick-up his father’s vehicle to avoid it being towed. As a result of ICE’s lies, Kevin has now been in ICE custody at Rio Cosumnes Correctional Center in Sacramento, California for nearly 3 months. During that time, Kevin missed the birth of his first child. These are moments, Kevin will never get back.\

Please show your support by packing the court on March 2nd!

IMPORTANT TO KNOW:

Arrive promptly so we can go into the courthouse together, even though hearings are scheduled to start 30 minutes after the times shown.

Let the security guard know whose bond hearing you are attending.

If you have a valid photo ID (driver’s license, etc.), please bring it. If you do not, you may ask for an escort to the courtroom.

Do NOT bring signs (they will be confiscated) or wear movement shirts/attire—our role is to show the judge that the person being detained has the support of the community, simply by our presence in the back of the courtroom. We cannot participate in or be seen as disrupting the proceedings in any way. Thank you for your support!
