HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT -- and more!  We're working with Nevada Democrats to build the foundations of a strong  coordinated Democratic campaign for the US Senate seat, House of Representatives and state offices in Nevada .  The Nevada seat is a MUST WIN if Democrats are to have any chance of taking back the Senate -- and potentially keeping Trump from filling another seat on the Supreme Court.

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

Please RSVP to phonebank\+owner@indivisibleberkeley.org, and we'll get back to you with more details.
