HELP FLIP THE NEVADA SENATE SEAT!  We're working with Nevada Democrats to build the foundations of a strong coordinated Democratic campaign for a US Senate seat, as well as seats in Congress and in state government.  The Nevada Senate seat is a MUST WIN if Democrats are to have any chance of taking back the Senate -- and potentially keeping Trump from filling yet another seat on the Supreme Court.

WHAT YOU'll NEED: a charged ipad, tablet or laptop and your cell phone with earbuds.  If possible, a power cord and a computer mouse might also be useful for you.

2 locations:  El Cerrito & West Berkeley!

Please RSVP, and we'll get back to you with more details.
