Join us at Neyborly on Friday for a blue-to-blue phone bank, calling Democrats whose Republican Senators are on the fence about the tax bill. We'll be using Indivisible's [dialer](https://www.trumptaxscam.org/calls-to-kill-the-tax-scam/), which you can also use at home!

Please bring: *phone, laptop*, headphones/earbuds, and some snacks to share if you'd like.

WE CAN DO THIS!!!
