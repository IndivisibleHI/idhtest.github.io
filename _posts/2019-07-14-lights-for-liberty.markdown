Indivisible Hawaii joined the Lights for Liberty Vigil. We had a good turnout, setup a table with our Indivisible Hawaii banner on it, sold ten T-shirts and Lisa was one of the speakers. Thanks to everyone who participated. The children imprisoned in these internment camps need our support which we will continue to give.
