Did you know that Dems lost U.S. House by 6675 votes?  

The point being: WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE- EVERY VOTE COUNTS!

Join us to write postcards to register left leaning voters in swing states NOW to WIN 2024!  Let's save democracy.  Let's protect our freedom.

We will provide postcards, names, instructions, etc  and will have postcards to take home + info on texts, calls & other actions. Bring family and friends.

If you can’t attend & but are interested, email us at natel+owner@indivisiblehawaii.org.
